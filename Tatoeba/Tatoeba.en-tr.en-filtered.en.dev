I didn't intend to hurt you. 
I can't bear this pain. 
Do you want me to call you a taxi? 
That's not in my bailiwick. 
Don't bother denying it. 
This is one of the basic rules. 
I believe that belongs to me. 
Like it or not, you have to do it. 
Tom waited on the porch while Mary got ready. 
That's your conclusion, not mine. 
Just call me Tom.

Do you take part in any community activities? 
We all wish for permanent world peace. 
I try to eat right. 
Can't you see what just happened? 
Attack! 
The verb "to eat" is my favorite verb in all the languages. 
We have to get back before Tom does. 
I think my German is really bad. 
Shortly after, they were married.

This seems stupid. 
I'm going to take some pictures. 
Let me put something on. 
I have to ask them to help us. 
I know you were close to Tom. 
I hope today's ball game won't be canceled.

I'm not sure that Tom will be able do that. 
I just wish Tom wasn't leaving tomorrow. 
Take me seriously. 
I wrote a letter to Jim. 
She warned us. 
Tom knew that Mary didn't like him much. 
Where have you been all week?

I can't sleep any more. 
What does all this mean? 
We have a lot of friends. 
I'm struggling to make ends meet. 
Tom is older than you think he is. 
We're dreamers. 
Do you think Tom is unbiased? 
A cup of coffee refreshed me. 
Tom took me to the station. 
Are you sure you can't come with me? 
The things that hurt us, teach us. 
It'll be no problem. 
Somebody, open this door, please.

There's a cockroach under the bed! 
When she saw me, she was embarrassed. 
Can you recommend a place for me to stay in London? 
I said such horrible things to him. I feel so awful. 
It was really easy. 
I went to the spa. 
We decided to go to the mountains today. 
Does that frighten you? 
We've brought enough food to feed everyone. 
Tom cracked up. 
They couldn't kill Tom. 
Tom didn't want to let Mary go. 
You will have a new sister. 
Tell Tom I'm going to be gone for three weeks. 
I don't think it was Tom and Mary. 
You knew I knew. 
The university bears the name of its founder. 
You need to tell us the truth. 
We're all part of the problem. 
Tom hasn't told me who did that yet. 
We're not desperate yet. 
I've known how to do that since I was a kid. 
Tom told us what had happened. 
I'll speak to Tom about what we just discussed.

I can't believe Tom just did that. 
Tom made his way toward the front door. 
Tom didn't want to harm Mary. 
Simplify your life. Take advice from native speakers. 
Can anyone verify that? 
Words express thoughts. 
Do you really think Tom is going to believe me? 
We have to do that today. 
It's not like you think. 
I had to refuse her offer. 
Would you like to get some dinner? 
John is good at math. 
He commutes to his office by bus. 
It looks like it might snow. 
I'm sure Tom will be here on time. 
I have never made a mistake. 
I thought you guys had a big party tonight. 
I don't think we should stay here much longer. 
I don't think Tom would've allowed you to do that. 
Let me talk to you a second. 
He was groggy from too much wine. 
What a generous offer! 
I'll follow you to the ends of the earth. 
I only speak French with them. 
I'd die without you. 
Tell us what you think. 
Tom sat down on the bed. 
Do you think Tom saw it, too? 
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't know I wasn't going to do that. 
How about eating out this morning for a change? 
I doubt Mary would be that stupid. 
This key doesn't work in this lock. 
She has a vivid imagination. 
Why did they fire Tom? 
Don't hesitate to ask if you wish to know something! 
That's not going to be fun. 
Err! Sorry, you are incorrect! 
Have you ever seen the picture painted by Picasso? 
Tom studies hard. 
When was the last time you tidied your room?
