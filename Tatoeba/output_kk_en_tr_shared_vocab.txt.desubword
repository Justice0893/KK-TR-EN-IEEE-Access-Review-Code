You can't help now . It's too late now .
Tom hung out in a bar with Mary all afternoon .
You can leave the baby with me for two days .
I should ask him if I were you .
Come home early .
Their behavior was shameful .
The car's kicking again .
The Battle of Salima was one of the most bloody wars in human history .
This year the situation is unprecedented .
I no longer have a home .
Do you hear me ?

What do I have to eat ?
We sent the book by mail .
Tom is finally alone .
Everybody has stopped working .
However , the current amount of wind varies with the position of the year and the season .

Tom finally found out the truth .
Tom hasn't yet been able to contact Mary .
Put out that fire .
You weren't that great .

It works for us .
We've never been to Boston .
You're more than ready to speak ill of others .
That was a stupid thing for you to do .
We can't do that anymore .
Just hang on .
Would you mind if I asked Tom something ?
Tom will be terrified .
Sami was so drunk that he didn't even notice that he had paid the prostitute .
I drink to forget .
Tom can't sing .
I didn't plan to tell you .
I have a special right of life .
Tom doesn't think he can do that .
He said that he gets up at six every morning .
His efforts came to nothing .
Studying a foreign language is difficult .
She reacted angrily .
I'll make some coffee . Do you want some , too ?
Tom couldn't contain his anger .
Tom doesn't look very healthy .
By the way , how many of you keep a diary ?
His village is just over the border .
Has Tom already been told about this ?
There's something I want to say .
You talked to her , didn't you ?
