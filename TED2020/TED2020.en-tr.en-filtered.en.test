The projects are things like, let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas. 
Now, Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral. 
So this is really remarkable, right? 
About 325 have been produced. 
The "Cover Girl" series proposed a different way the African can be represented in a more complex manner. 
Yeah! 
One is: If people must pay for a bed net, are they going to purchase them? 
Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less." 
The spider's responding to its external world in a way that we get to see and know what's happening to its internal world. 
As of the end of last year, 1,314 men had run under four minutes in the mile, but like Jesse Owens, Sir Roger Bannister ran on soft cinders that stole far more energy from his legs than the synthetic tracks of today. 
The Dassey case is also unique because it led to such intense public outrage. 
And that information will go into AskNature.org. 
It does something intrinsic to the act. 
And we were unprepared for this, and they were shaping the aid effort. 
It accepts that I'm going to have to die but says, despite that, I can rise up and I can live again. 
And that's actually where our story begins. 
Just as we created it. 
The past 100 years have been what historians now call an "American Century." 
You could make guesses about my ethnicity, my political affiliation, my religious beliefs. 
So I know I went super fast. 
So that means that all 1.3 billion Chinese have grown up with "The Emperor's New Clothes," "The Matchstick Girl" and "The Little Mermaid." 
Those are potatoes, by the way. 
Now we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber. 
And you can see here, as this animates over, Steven's actual data against the background of all other patients, against this information. 
Fourth, they are taught that a good patient interview and a thorough clinical exam provide most of the clues for diagnosis, saving costly technology for confirmation. 
It invites us into the world but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture. 
They ask me why I teach and I reply, 'Where could I find such splendid company?'" And I believe the teaching profession -- it's true, you have so many youngsters, and I've got to think of my youngsters at UCLA -- 30-some attorneys, 11 dentists and doctors, many, many teachers and other professions. 
And I plucked the hair off the fly's head. 
And it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical, OK? 
And so what does that mean? 
Now, that was 20 years ago, and now I visit companies that have banned coffee cups at desks because they want people to hang out around the coffee machines and talk to each other. 
So the Bitcoin blockchain is core to how Bitcoin works. 
Now, both Islam and Christianity underscore the importance of social impact as critical tenets of our faith. 
Let's take a closer look. 
By accident. 
And everybody is shocked when the old man takes off his head covering and shows himself. 
Some women became quiet and disappeared. 
It's like after every exam, when I walk out, the teacher would say, "Hey, come. 
Surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore; they had become gods. 
Too relentless, like the valley that filled with the putrid smoke of our deaths. 
So for six days, I lived in front of a webcam. 
By the way, don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law because I haven't invented those yet; it always sounds better if there's a third law, doesn't it? 
So it causes a lot of inner conflict, you know, like part of me likes me, part of me hates me. 
It's in the same gallery or in the same museum. 
They look at Karajan. And then they look at each other. 
Or that a woman is more likely to be a personal assistant than a CEO. 
That's Evelyn. Five months later, that is the difference that we are making. 
But today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic. 
And we got some answers from you out there, and it helped us a very lot to build the program. 
He was kidnapped from Kabul by a warlord. 
The financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes skyrocketed, and it tipped toward the tiny upper echelon of performance. 
As I crouched next to him, he told me that he wanted to kill himself. 
Like, "Do we like the Budweiser commercial?" 
So instead of replying, I gave back one of my largest smiles as I saw, in flashing light, the following sign in my mind's eye. 
I went to study in Sambalpur, the largest town in the region, where, already in college, I saw a television for the first time. 
and they were full of doubt. 
So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse. 
And she sells the milk to the villagers, and pays off the loan. 
Three days ago, my wife calls me, crying. 
He's literally, he's got no shoulder on one side, and he's high trans-humeral on the other. 
Your calculations have given you a 46-digit number for the count of rabbits in the bottom cell– plenty of room to spare. 
(Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) 
To do this, I would need to switch from flat drawings for books to 3D sculpture for the street, and I'd need almost 200 feet, a New York City block, to build a large-scale model of the moon, the Earth and us. 
When people come back to the office, they can see each other and they know each other in a deeper way. 
And who pays the price? 
Because we've got to stop, we've got to do something where we unite -- separate from all the politics and religion that, as a young person, is confusing me. 
It's a trick question. There are no sewers. 
It's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal. 
While all of this is going on, familiar symptoms, like high temperatures and swelling, are actually processes designed to aid the immune response. 
Christopher Columbus convinced the King of Spain to send him on a mission to find a better trade route to India, not by going East over land but sailing West around the globe. 
[Help! I've been waiting for over 20 minutes and nothing happens.] (Laughter) This person thought they needed to wait. 
There's some venture capital investments that were well-meaning and didn't go well. 
I've never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns, which are so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives. 
Now, every week, we have the equivalent of 84 million disks, which record our archival information on past, current and future projects. 
Well-trained women are as capable as their male counterparts in overall fitness, but more importantly, in how they police. 
TK: Yes, it's called "Good Flag, Bad Flag: How to Design a Great Flag." 
So, here we have "figure" in black. 
One box, four packs, eight pastries. 
But apparently, that was not an issue at the time. 
I'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party. 
And one of the issues is capacity. 
Well, it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing in the computational universe. 
Alright, so, why does ketchup act all weird? 
Someday, being gay will be a simple fact, free of party hats and blame. 
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions. 
That's not the point." 
As I pursued my career, something was always gnawing away inside me. 
If six of them pick out the same person, there's a good chance that's the real culprit, and if all ten make the same choice, you might think the case is rock solid, but you'd be wrong. 
And then we can, at the same time, create this roof garden above the building where you can visit and enjoy the view. 
And that's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods. 
India is food self-sufficient and in the past decade has actually been exporting calories. 
Usually, an immune response will eradicate a threat within a few days. 
"I know that our situations are different," he wrote to me, "But the threat of death lurks in both of our shadows." 
You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book. 
You realize that the only lockers touched twice have to be prime numbers since each only has two factors: 1 and itself. 
She started with just one Roots  Shoots group and now she has 4,000 groups around the world. 
I'm Steve Ritz, this is Green Bronx Machine. 
It’s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma, which is just Alzheimer’s disease of the eye. 
DS: Yep. 
You are going to struggle to make ends meet. 
And he saved up and he purchased this, and he proposed to my mother with this, and so I thought that I would give it to you so that he could be with us for this also. 
So in Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together. 
So we can't even compare generations across various areas of the world. 
And if you look along the coast of Argentina, where I work now, at a place called Punta Tombo -- the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about 44 degrees south latitude -- you see that there's great variation here. 
Like, hats off to South Africa and Turkey and Israel and Somalia and Japan and Gambia. 
What if we integrate traditional farming that requires a lot of energy together with high-tech and combine those? 
I met a man who, nine years ago, was arrested for panhandling in a Walgreens. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Just a quick question on timeline. 
When one ant touches another, it's smelling it, and it can tell, for example, whether the other ant is a nest mate because ants cover themselves and each other, through grooming, with a layer of grease, which carries a colony-specific odor. 
What I didn't see come my way was the women and children whom we served time and shared space with, women who had been imprisoned for crimes of the system, the corruption that requires a fall guy, a scapegoat, so that the person who is responsible could go free, a broken system that routinely vilifies the vulnerable, the poorest amongst us, people who cannot afford to pay bail or bribes. 
This is the rate of innovation versus time in very different conditions. 
But why is the technical overload crisis, the complexity crisis, accelerating now? 
And each one of these forces split the world, tore the world apart, divided the world. 
The US Secret Service, two months ago, froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here, and that bank account had 14.9 million US dollars in it when it was frozen. 
I could spend weeks trying to find this in ones and zeros, but it takes me seconds to pick out a visual abstraction like this. 
We think doodling is something you do when you lose focus, but in reality, it is a preemptive measure to stop you from losing focus. 
So there's this gap in what we know, just because no one was there to ask a question. 
Then came the peace process, and when the peace process started, the whole mindset of the guerrilla changed. 
Trump's mass separations of refugee families at the southern border shocked the conscience of the world and woke many to the cruelties of the US immigration system. 
(Pre-recorded applause) I'd like to tell all of you a little joke. 
So innovators would have much stronger incentives than they do now to make sure that every patient who takes the drug knows exactly how to take it to optimal effect. 
Food is really irrelevant. 
This effect is so robust, we find it no matter how we ask the question. 
HW: And so when you talk about legibility and digital literacy, I find it difficult to imagine that we need to place the burden of digital literacy on users themselves. 
And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction. 
It collects about 20,000 such sentences a day and it's been running for about a year and a half, having collected over 10 and a half million feelings now. 
We named it after the goddess Hestia, the Greek goddess of the hearth and home, because we think the Earth became one. 
And also, there are other ways of activating FOXO that don't even involve insulin or IGF-1 that might even be safer. 
First of all, we have all the statistical analyses from the Innocence Project work, where we know that we have, what, 250, 280 documented cases now where people have been wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated, some from death row, on the basis of later DNA analysis, and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases of exoneration involved only eyewitness identification testimony during the trial that convicted them. 
I'm guessing most of you have paid your tickets as well. 
You can't enroll in university. 
Audience member 2: Spade. 
We live in a digital world, but we're fairly analog creatures. 
These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions: How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now? 
I filled out a long application, answering questions about my current and my past affiliations. 
I don't see any reason why it shouldn't. 
Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food. 
It's really taking individualized medicine to a new height and it's hyper-innovative, and I think it represents the black swan of medicine. 
There are websites like DonorsChoose that recognize the disparity and actually want to do something about it. 
People are eating animal protein whether we like it or not. 
Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to. 
(Applause) I will not end here with what went wrong; I would not be doing justice to the warmth we found in those families. 
What if there was another way, a win-win for everyone? 
So, see, kids like us, we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school, and sometimes we're just not ready to focus. 
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath. 
Back in the South Bronx where I grew up, building 700, apartment 2E. 
That's a good thing to do, right? 
It wasn't solved until 1655. 
Smith says, that would matter a lot. 
And this, actually, is good news to trendsetters; they want trends to be set so that they can move product. 
And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York. 
But Howard urged me to open myself up to uncertainty, to the possibilities of new love, new loss. 
Gets up to 600, 700 degrees F, somewhere in that range. 
(Laughter) Or just like you? Really? 
So, it's controlled. 
Fifth, and the most incredible, sometimes when parrotfish cozy up into a nook in the reef at night, they secrete a mucus bubble from a gland in their head that envelops their entire body. 
And so I started to learn, because learning was cool. 
We can try this first. If I just put them on the table together, there's no reason for them to synchronize, and they probably won't. 
And we wondered how they use these bizarre toes to climb up a wall so quickly. 
I just want to end with a quote by one of our greatest freedom fighters who's no longer with us, Nelson Mandela of South Africa. 
Nowadays, it's no ma'am, check your shoes. And like -- (Laughter) But then it wasn't -- they didn't have any, but the guy had -- I said, what kind of salts of potassium do you have? You know. 
So I couldn't know -- I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried. 
These plant-based companies have spent small fortunes on their burgers, and cell-based meat has not yet been commercialized at all. 
As animals blessed with the power of rational thought, we can marvel at the intricacies of life. 
But anyway, these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important. 
On a manual typewriter it was very difficult, and even when we had electric typewriters, or then computer keyboards, the fact is that even if you can type easily enough to keep up with the pace of speech, more or less, you have to have somebody who can receive your message quickly. 
So it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing -- any decision is a prioritization, so of course we are still prioritizing, if only implicitly -- and that's unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization, and went in and talked about it. 
There is a hash tag there that you can use, #CBDQ. 
The brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns, finding relationships in information, and associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning, a significance, by interacting with the world. 
You then have some body part descriptions: "It's in the liver, in the breast, in the prostate." 
Mark Twain says that proper preparation, or teaching, is so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good, it can turn awful practices into powerful ones, it can change men and transform them into angels. 
Because in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate and own most of the mines -- copper, zinc, gold -- and they truck the resources south and east into mainland China. 
But our friends who are condensed matter physicists managed to come up, some 50 years ago, with a very nice device, shown under that bell jar, which is a transistor. 
And when you view stress in that way, your body believes you, and your stress response becomes healthier. 
And that would be represented by the firing of boundary-detecting cells. 
Sex workers are real people. 
Shortly after, I went to a women's college in Boston, then Michigan. 
But instead of landing a job in a pharmaceutical company or a hospital, I found myself drawn to a different kind of lab, working with a different kind of patient -- a patient whose illness was so serious it impacted every single person in my country; a patient who needed to get healthy fast. 
People like Josh and Steve are continuing to layer information upon information, real-time information, Tweet it and text it onto these maps for all to use. 
But it was a single-witness case, so we took a look at it. 
I was not a people person back then. 
This is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we've got. 
Otherwise, we should call it what it really is: poverty insurance. 
If you have an empty stomach, your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin. 
Girl: Yes I do. I remember writing every chapter. 
So, the good news is that I have a dog and, though I don't know if I believe in luck -- I don't know what I believe in, it's a very complicated question, but I do know that before I go away, I crank his tail seven times. 
Sometimes I get voice mails saying that if I continue telling my jokes, they'll kill me and they'll kill my family. 
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge. 
We'd never been parents before, my wife and I, and so treated him like most guests when he arrived home for the first time, by giving him the tour. 
The code -- we call this an encryption key. 
This is me with a classroom of 11-year-olds. 
And in getting there, it doesn't just follow one route; it follows multiple pathways at once, to optimize the most efficient way of reaching the reaction center without dissipating as waste heat. 
The main researcher of this trait, Robert McCrae, says that "Open individuals have an affinity for liberal, progressive, left-wing political views ..." 
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff, but it's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world -- well less than one percent. 
How do we democratize globalization? 
Now, all of you know that geopolitics is best followed by watching ping-pong. 
That's a huge responsibility, a huge burden on everyone's shoulders, yes. 
And she said, "It's neither good nor bad." 
Then over the late '40s, '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s, waves of decolonization took place. 
SW: We're thinking medium size. We don't want to do too big, but then we're like, OK, we can't say no to this person, this person. 
The response time would simply be too slow. 
Each of these universes has extra dimensions. 
Affirmative action is not very popular frankly, with white voters, period. 
Then they went out to an abandoned airstrip with two cars, the target victim car and the chase car, and they launched a bunch of other attacks. 
And it generates the empathy that we need to overcome all the ways that we try to hurt one another. 
And Gene was showing Natasha how to use a knife and fork, and then Natasha was returning the utensil lessons. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session, and from all the different presenters. 
And lastly: this is not just an American motto anymore. 
So let's push that Vegas example a bit. 
No ocean, no life support system. 
And the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions, but when we study superstring theory, we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling, new form. 
So why do we care about this? 
(Laughter) Even our popular media hates humans. 
We know this because of long-term science, because we have long-term studies there. 
I couldn't scale them up or down, I couldn't really do anything of that sort. 
Let me act compassionately. 
On the train home, she gave me a present: a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim. 
AM: Yeah, I definitely have to be moving, and balance is a little bit of an art in them. 
I'll just list a couple of them. 
We have to hold something at 150 million degrees. 
And yes, this is a bit much for everyday life, but it made me wonder: What about the rest of us? 
They've even tried to grow little mini-organs in the lab. 
And those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands, potentially millions of ways. 
And I say this with humility, because I came late to the issue of climate change. 
These vibrations send waves into the air, which our brains interpret as sound. 
People believe that when we deal with physical attraction, we see somebody, and we know immediately whether we like them or not, if we're attracted or not. 
But I didn't really think it affected me. 
Let me give you a little sense of how this would work. 
And then one night, Priam, king of Troy, an old man, comes into the Greek camp incognito, makes his way to Achilles' tent to ask for the body of his son. 
Determination is, like, you're going to hang on that bull, even if you're riding upside down. 
The answer depends on the exact shape of the universe, the amount of dark energy it holds, and changes in its expansion rate. 
And it's from X-ray crystallography, so it's an accurate model of DNA. 
Pournima was 18 years old when she was in a car accident where she lost her leg, and she traveled 12 hours by train to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee, and while all of the amputees who wear our knees affect us as the designers, she's particularly meaningful to me as an engineer and as a woman, because she was in school, she had just started school to study engineering. 
My little five-year-old kid neighbor comes running in, and he says, "Rags, Rags. 
Turns out to be the exterior wall -- that part of it that remains -- of the Coliseum, so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch and have a spectacular view. 
What's unexpected about this is that it's soft, but it's also a strong magnet. 
Time flies. 
TM: And I can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing, or on the other. 
I've heard about recruiters who are quick to label a candidate a job-hopper based on a single short stint on their resume; read about professors who are more likely to ignore identical messages from students because their name was black or Asian instead of white. 
Others think about Malthusian nightmares. 
We reduce them to childlike qualities. 
And of course, we are not there to say that's only for us, it's not for them. 
(Laughter) So, now I'm a filmmaker, or, the beginning of a filmmaker, and I started using the tools that are available to me as a filmmaker to try to tell the most compelling stories that I can to an audience. 
Okay, so, how much does a video weigh? 
In the years since Huxley, science has learned a lot about brain activity, but the relationship between brain activity and conscious experiences is still a mystery. 
According to this theory, children learn languages more easily because the plasticity of their developing brains lets them use both hemispheres in language acquisition, while in most adults, language is lateralized to one hemisphere, usually the left. 
This kind of thinking drives economists crazy, and it should. 
My son, I don't know where he is. 
The first is that the experience of the ant -- of each ant -- can't be very predictable. 
But schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic status, and there are people with the illness who are full-time professionals with major responsibilities. 
Now I'd like you to remember that result, and put it in the context of another group of technology users, a group which is actually much revered by society, which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking. 
Now, this gives a real meaning to the term "blind faith," which doesn't have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people. 
When many people think of coding, they think of it as something that only a very narrow sub-community of people are going to be doing, and they think of coding looking like this. 
And it's not just the tech community that are after these things. 
And they see that internal diagram of a woman's reproductive system -- you know, the one that looks kind of like a steer head -- (Laughter) And it always grays out between the legs. 
Some of the world's most popular apps are dating apps, an industry now worth more than, or close to, three billion dollars a year. 
But they have a closed system, so you couldn't print the things out on the machine. 
So let's begin. 
As we live longer and longer, surviving illnesses and injuries that would have killed our grandparents, even our parents, the vast majority of us will travel back and forth between these realms, spending much of our lives somewhere between the two. 
(Laughter) And it's not just how we produce food, but what we consume that has a massive impact on global warming. 
Kendall's 15 months older than Jay. 
She says, "Well, guess what? I'd like you leave, you're finished." 
The first ones we inherit at a young age from our parents, who of course have their own skewed beliefs, their own frustrations, their own unlived lives. 
That had to be done by other people. 
They all experimented with negating the parallel postulate, only to discover that this gave rise to entire alternative geometries. 
This is not the end, this is the beginning of the end." 
(Laughter) And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices, where there are so many features and options, you have to do two dimensions, you know: a vertical and a horizontal. 
Well, you've got mail. 
Our sewers are crumbling. 
Here's an even bigger jump: mathematical knot theory, first developed around 1771 to describe the geometry of position, was used in the late 20th century to explain how DNA unravels itself during the replication process. 
And the reason is, because although innovation, of course, takes place in big businesses, takes place in world-class universities, it also takes place in the fringes, because those on the fringes -- the pariahs, the outcasts -- they're often the most creative, because they have to be. 
What does this do? 
And I asked him one question. 
They also pollute their next-door neighbors. 
They're supervisors, and they watch every conversation and step in if needed. 
But then I started to wonder: What actually happens to us when we get bored? 
And this is the plot behind Stuxnet. 
And as we become more of a global company, we find these things really affect us -- you know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room? 
And then he added, "But our water has no impurities." 
None of those things were stirring. 
So, keys provide an access to shelter and warmth -- transport as well, in the U.S. increasingly. 
And we went in, pretending to be buyers. 
And despite this being a universal human right, one billion people today have no record they exist, making it one of the greatest human rights violations of our time, yet nobody seems to know about it. 
So I want to come back to my final question: instead of weakening our forests, how can we reinforce them and help them deal with climate change? 
When I was in fourth grade, my teacher said to us one day: "There are as many even numbers as there are numbers." 
Sadly, their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface. 
First, I want to explain how and why crack cocaine had such a profound influence on inner-city gangs. 
I'm not saying that this could solve everything, but it could introduce technology to people who originally wouldn't be interested in it because of how it has been portrayed and taught in school. 
And at the first bend in that river, Mark's surgeon told us what movement and feeling he doesn't get back in the first 12 weeks, he's unlikely to get back at all. 
Do this with compassion. 
It has the three fingers, the three digits. 
But would it make it easier for you to know what's true? 
So bigotry isn't just immoral, it can even be lethal. 
Joker: Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh! (Music) MT: But today, I am performing for a different kind of audience. 
One day, I was at a friend's office at work, and I noticed this book on the shelf, "Fluid Fuel Reactors." 
And he told me the following story: He said that for more than two weeks, he was working on a PowerPoint presentation. 
So back in the day, when us Indians wanted to travel we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky. 
And that gives me great hope, really, in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities, and saying, what is the important thing in the world? 
God will forgive us. 
And for Galois this was like the zeroth symmetry. 
It is a fully autonomous system. 
And finally, an acronym. 
(Applause) At one point -- Thanks. 
And the idea here is that all our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day. 
If local democracy is to flourish, it is about the active and informed engagement of every citizen. 
We are young until we are not. 
And what's happened in the past year alone is the dairy industry -- where this card's used for milk and yogurt and eggs and hummus -- the dairy industry has gone up 30 percent. 
And we can do that. 
I distinctly remember one game in high school. 
So, after 100 years of being able to listen to any telephone call -- anytime, anywhere -- you might imagine that government officials are not very happy. 
And these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens. 
Their numbers have never recovered. 
Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you. 
Agreeable people are warm and friendly, they're nice, they're polite. 
But in the great scheme of things, it's a pinprick, one of about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which you can see on a clear night as a pale white mist stretched across the sky. 
And we put that wall around the World Church of God, and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for the army. 
This bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planetary biologists hoping to find clues to life on other planets by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours. 
Poaching -- oh, no way. 
On January 14, 2011, Ben Ali fled out of Tunisia after mounting protests against his regime. 
He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless. 
And if I told you it was all coming for free, you would say, this is simply -- you're dreaming. 
In comparison to my pound of flesh, where you can see the light goes everywhere. 
You have to just take your cameras with you. 
Without the memory there would be no story to tell. 
And its CEO asked a few very pertinent questions: Why would anyone today still want to go to the office, because you can actually work anywhere?

A wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims. 
One of them, Lolly, came in, and this is what she said the day she came in.

Here's an example from Hong Kong, where some kids made a game and then built their own physical interface device and had a light sensor, so the light sensor detects the hole in the board, so as they move the physical saw, the light sensor detects the hole and controls the virtual saw on the screen and saws down the tree.

I meet plenty of economic migrants. 
And what made that institutional founding especially important is that Maryland is the South, as you know, and, quite frankly, it was the first university in our state founded at a time when students of all races could go there. 
(Applause) So to go back to that Hollywood paraphrase, we do want the prodigious potential of artificial intelligence and digital technology to blossom, but for that, we must face this prodigious menace, open-eyed and now. 
The audience will see right through you. 
And in a way, they are less impacted by our day to day activities. 
But while that competition is going on within the boat, this competition is going on across boats.

And then they can also, when you snap, line up exactly the way you'd like to. 
Let's look at how memories form in the first place. 
As a palliative care provider, I ask all my patients what they're hoping for and what they're afraid of.

HP: (In Chinese) YR: If I may, I would like to tell you a little bit about myself and my artwork. 
The illusion of speech follows incidentally. 
And I was so relieved to hear that he was OK. 
There are many others like it. 
They just seemed unnecessary and cute in the end. 
It really doesn't, because we have this incredible capacity for togetherness and belonging, and by invoking that capacity, we can recover those amazing components of our humanity: our altruism and cooperation. 
So again, good learning. We learned not to do that again. 
So we're in this vicious, habitual cycle. 
We were having a hard time explaining the origin of the outer ring in Hoag-type galaxies. 
It's about how do you design to rebuild trust, trusting relationships? 
A few decades ago, many scientists believed that this could actually be possible. 
We can think of a politician trying to present a position, trying to convince the audience of something. 
I don't like playing. 
That 90 percent means local jobs. 
So, they completely miss the metaphorical meaning. 
A network is not just the product of its component parts. 
The people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones. 
One answer would be: because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high and they bounce against things rapidly -- that's a kind of physical science argument. 
And it's going to give you a little more ease in your life. 
And now this. 
For example, you all know these hearing aids? 
In the Western world, divorce rates are about 40 percent. 
What was that about? 
I wanted to see how children coped with challenge and difficulty, so I gave 10-year-olds problems that were slightly too hard for them. 
What is rewarding about helping is knowing that your help landed, that it had impact, that you were effective. 
They do exist. Here's how they work. 
Some people deceive for money. 
Only 32 signs across a 30,000-year time span and the entire continent of Europe. 
Let me bring things together step-by-step. 
During my research I worked in nursing homes, and I brought in these sociable robots that were designed to give the elderly the feeling that they were understood. 
Yes. 
An acquaintance let them use a cellar under his studio. 
The space between bones gets bigger, but the amount of synovial fluid stays constant. 
(Laughter) I'm a big believer in the emotion of design, and the message that's sent before somebody begins to read, before they get the rest of the information; what is the emotional response they get to the product, to the story, to the painting -- whatever it is. 
You're in there. You're stuck. 
And in the supermarket, I promise my daughter Noor, that if she says to me, "Thanks (Arabic)," I won't say, "Dis, 'Merci, Maman,'" and hope no one has heard her. 
At the end — you see where this is going — people were asked whether they agreed with the conclusions of the article. 
And so then we took off to actually stop these loggers. 
So my theory is that when you apply media to this pendulum, it starts swinging faster and faster, until it's at both extremes nearly simultaneously, and that effectively blurs the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public. 
Not in most cases, and not in the preponderance of cases, but in every single instance where he made some reference to the Holocaust, that his supposed evidence was distorted, half-truth, date-changed, sequence-changed, someone put at a meeting who wasn't there. 
There was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero. 
And how does that compare to the people you work with? 
And he said, "The Amazon." 
And remember -- (Applause) Remember, anyone who asks you, "Are they properly vetted?" 
A child's Playstation today is more powerful than a military supercomputer from 1996. 
The thing I had to admit to myself, with great repulsion, was that I get it. 
The feeling of being dedicated to something meaningful, of belonging to something bigger and of being empowered is crucial for creativity and innovation. 
Imagine how long it would have taken before: dozens of people, many years. 
With no time to spare, the iron comes to life, and you manage to get the shirt flawlessly ironed. 
And they said, "Well you can dig." And we decided to dig up, instead of digging down. 
That led to 550 entries from 53 countries. 
And that is why we must continue to work. 
Boy: Oh, because the light goes only to here, not here. 
In its context, it is not manufacturable by traditional manufacturing techniques. 
In my work, I've often heard women express that they're uncomfortable communicating their value, especially early on in business ownership. 
Imagine for a second that this was a sun a billion light years away, and you had a little speck of dust that came in front of it. 
The trucks could even use natural gas. 
It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing. 
And you'll see here the planets as well as some spacecraft that are also orbiting our sun. 
And what we found was that, very similar to external stress and external distraction in the environment, internal distraction, our own mind wandering, also shrinks the gap of attention. 
(Video) Comment: Couldn't follow because of the Indian accent. 
Well, it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted. 
The result is that people, whether they're inept or highly skilled, are often caught in a bubble of inaccurate self-perception. 
On the current trajectory, how far are we going to get by 2030? 
For the hundred or so countries that are ranked below China, more than half of them are electoral democracies. 
But if it can help out with this one, if it can make a dent in this, it makes me wonder, what else can we design for next? 
This increase in velocity will help make sure collisions have the appropriate amount of energy necessary to ensure book-dropping. 
Here are some of the things that we do. 
I hear a lot of this talk about how we all need to start talking to each other more and understanding each other more, and I've even written about this, published on this subject as well, but now today I keep hearing liberals -- yes, I live in New York, I can be considered a liberal -- we sit here and self-analyze: What did we do to not understand the Rust Belt? 
So that's okay, isn't it? 
But they didn't steal anything. 
One of the children was old enough to realize that the way his nanny was being treated was wrong, and he gave her the money that he had been saving through his childhood to help her escape. 
And this ethical problem's a big problem. 
They seem to come from the outside and to mimic perception. 
Now, the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains, exactly now, as you watch me doing this, you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do the actions. 
And I firmly believe that our job in those times is to disrupt what is happening. 
And he proposed this machine called the memex. 
Lawyers have to disclose conflicts of interests. 
As they had run from the wave, and for their lives, absolutely everything they had, everything had to be left behind. 
Yes, I know Mailer wasn't writing about me. 
But, using the language of Galois, we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same. 
(Laughter) I didn't expect that. 
So we carefully removed the rocks, loaded them into the pack and rappelled back down. 
Are there any Monkeys here? 
I was appalled by the possibility of this city of bright and vivid sunsets being overrun by a dull haze.

The highest concentration is in our brains. 
If we do not change our behavior and wean ourselves off antibiotics, the UN predicts that by 2050, antimicrobial resistance will become our single biggest killer. 
And so, on the last day of camp, I got up early and I got a big cantaloupe from the grocery store and I hid it in the ivy, and then at lunchtime, I was like, "Riley, why don't you go over there and see what you've done." 
Every writer you know writes really terrible first drafts, but they keep their butt in the chair. 
And they are partly right about that. 
And they can also sense their motion and tilt. 
You see, sight is just one way we shape our reality. 
So I thought maybe I could train an army of toxin-cleaning edible mushrooms to eat my body. 
It's the 30th anniversary of GMO crops and the Big Gulp, Chicken McNuggets, high-fructose corn syrup, the farm crisis in America and the change in how we've addressed agriculture internationally. 
What might the bottlenecks be? 
It can change your workflow -- actually, it can change everything in your company; it can turn your company upside down. 
And where are they looking to for inspiration? 
The vast majority of the online crime cases, we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from. 
There's also been work done with monkeys. 
That's what it's shrunk to. 
Only 4.1 percent are women. 
But while living in Zimbabwe, I didn't see my role as an advocacy or a political one. 
Video: (Music) DM: We'll start by putting a lead into two sequence Siftables, arrange them into a series, extend it, add a little more lead. 
(Applause) About a year and a half ago we were asked to design an installation in the museum -- this is a new wing of the Science Museum in London, and it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues. 
They were always magnificent, because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific, right? 
NB: Yeah, unless there were something that is easy to do on purpose but that wouldn't happen by random chance. 
Like a person offered to swallow a red pill or a blue pill, I could choose to see my daughter's differences as bad; I could strive toward the goal that her therapists called, "You'd never know." 
We don't seem to see them. 
The stories of A.B. and Musu have taught me something fundamental about being human. 
But once at university, I was able to find a new identity for myself, and the nerd became a popular girl.

In the United States, where I live, there have been no congressional hearings. 
And once you engage the psychology of teams, it shuts down open-minded thinking. 
For many years now, they don't have the sufficient cold weather to actually control the population of this beetle. 
And it was very exciting and I learned some remarkable things and made some wonderful connections that I want to share with you today. 
So ill equipped are we all, to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims." 
Do you need to find entrepreneurs, or venture capitalists, or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale? 
"I really hate bothering you with this." 
Now, Westerners always assume that multi-party election with universal suffrage is the only source of political legitimacy. 
By any economic standard, the demand for art of all forms is skyrocketing, as you can tell from the price of opera tickets, by the number of books sold, by the number of books published, the number of musical titles released, the number of new albums and so on. 
Marijuana acts on the body’s cannabinoid system, which has receptors all over the brain and body. 
If you were to put an actual street map on top of what you've just drawn, you'd realize your streets and the distances -- they'd be way off. 
(Laughter) And what this has allowed is the creation of origami-on-demand. 
They live inside a human being's intestines. 
What really matters is that you spent it on somebody else rather than on yourself. 
Your brain's visual cortex operates on assumptions about the lighting of this image. 
Now, as a black man in America, that resonated with me. 
The hi-tech industry would like stronger protections for producers. 
When I started in journalism -- Financial Times, 20 years ago -- it was very, very exciting to see someone reading the newspaper. 
Well, I was studying physics at the beginning and I took this approximation of a human as a gigantic Lego piece. 
I've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation, hopefully for a good cause, which is self-improvement. 
Then this guy came to me and said, "Man, why you don't write in English?" 
One day, Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music. 
Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research recently, you'll see it's a crude face of political domination. 
(Laughter) My talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer, and then as a worried member of the human race. 
But I've also seen how difficult it is for them to become parents. 
Decision makers and industries, leaders and politicians, they went back to business as usual, exploiting our livelihoods like there is literally no tomorrow, building coal power plants again and again, even though we know that needs to stop, according to the Paris Agreement. 
Actually, all of them are. 
I saw how this had beaten them down. 
So, eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32. 
I see large groups of women in tattered uniforms surrounded by huge walls and gates, enclosed by iron barbed wires, and I get hit by an awful stench, and I ask myself, how did I move from working in the respected financial banking sector, having worked so hard in school, to now being locked up in the largest correctional facility for women in Kenya? 
Now, the irony is, of course, that every large company started off as a small, entrepreneurial company. 
Arraigning Christopher would give him a criminal record, making it harder for him to get a job, setting in motion a cycle that defines the failing criminal justice system today. 
(Laughter) ... if we use pennies. 
Well, it would answer "ulu," or no to the embedded question, so it lies and replies 'ozo' instead. 
(Laughter) Come down with pneumonia, and your mother will rush you to the nearest hospital for medical treatment. 
Now, everything I've shown you so far are regions that are involved in different aspects of perception, vision and hearing. 
I know this because I am one of them. 
And this sort of fixes me for them. 
I don't have ego involved in this. (Laughter) Give it away. Share it with people, because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power. 
His tags popped off in the Caribbean, and even in Brazil. 
The songs are a little similar, but mostly I'm just interested in the idea that someday maybe we'll buy a song because we like the way it looks. 
The other problem was the suit was so buoyant that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up. 
And that's where the deepest happiness has actually come from. 
You don't hear anything they're saying! 
I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because, currently on planet Earth, we're killing over 100 million sharks every single year. 
Because governments and businesses will fight over this power game, but where are we? 
You're able to free yourself from your past. 
I hope nobody finds that offensive. 
And the second was something one of our teachers told us. 
No additive manufacturing today gets even close to this level of sophistication. 
That's why it was so important that my classroom be a place where my students could build the muscle of confidence, where they could learn to face each day with the confidence you need to redesign the world in the image of your own dreams. 
And during the day I would announce myself as I entered the room, careful not to startle or agitate him. 
Which means, yes, I have a little shame; no, I'm a sociopath. 
And I had to because I had to raise the money. 
It was a difficult project to finance, because banks weren't interested in the neighborhood because people weren't interested in the neighborhood because nothing had happened there. 
That's my father's letter to me, telling me to marry the woman I first married when I was 20. 
Good question. 
But what happens when, even in the face of that fear, you do what you've got to do? 
Their spending loads, loads, to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well. 
So Anne then found herself on the streets and in and out of homeless shelters, and it's here where she started using drugs and alcohol to numb this pain she felt inside. 
So he figured that out. It took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television. 
Growing up, I was obsessed with fashion. 
If you do the math, that's 40,000 dollars a year. 
When I told some of my friends this, they were really shocked. 
Because some people think that the $100 laptop just happened a year ago, or two years ago, or we were struck by lightning -- this actually has gone back a long time, and in fact, back to the '60s. 
We need to stop thinking about technology as a solution to all of our problems, but think of it as a guide to what those problems actually are, so we can start thinking about them properly and start to address them. 
So they poke at it and peck at it. 
And so we're trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy, the beauty of the canopy, the necessity of intact canopies, to people outside of academia. 
It turns out, holding everything else constant, you are considerably more likely to be executed if you look like the man on the right than the man on the left, and this is in large part because the man on the right looks more prototypically black, more prototypically African-American, and this apparently influences people's decisions over what to do about him. 
And I came to the conclusion, this is a symptom of a larger problem. 
And you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases. 
They have a biological predisposition to go to bed late and get up late, so give them a break. 
So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be. 
People panic. 
The announcement just came out the last few weeks. 
(Laughter) You know, it's kinda weak. 
Well, meeting Bandura was really cathartic for me, because I realized that this famous scientist had documented and scientifically validated something that we've seen happen for the last 30 years: that we could take people who had the fear that they weren't creative, and we could take them through a series of steps, kind of like a series of small successes, and they turn fear into familiarity. 
Nicotine and other chemicals from the cigarette simultaneously cause constriction of blood vessels and damage their delicate endothelial lining, restricting blood flow. 
But you can see in more detail, and even more interesting, this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy. 
And fourth, we must be in a low-stakes situation, because if mistakes are to be expected, then the consequence of making them must not be catastrophic, or even very significant. 
But a big question in the field has been: Why? 
Now there is another kind of mirror neuron, which is involved in something quite different. 
They don't have the capacity for legal rights. 
And the point is not to treat these topics as topics of study, but as frameworks of action. 
Many divide their time used for effective practice into multiple daily practice sessions of limited duration. 
But it is the allegory of bad government that has been haunting me since November 9. 
The animal could be a cow, lamb, or even something more exotic. 
The patient doesn't have to travel. 
(Laughter) Or I was one of the people who did it. 
What kind of criteria did it use? 
You collect interest and do nothing in between. 
I used to hate lions, but now because my invention is saving my father's cows and the lions, we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict. 
So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules, which you saw, but they're a little bit different. 
So these are a few examples of the new abilities that we can gain by using nanotechnology to upgrade our tattoos, but this really is only the beginning. 
His great-granddad had been Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton gin. 
So when you're sitting and thinking about how do we move forward on this major issue -- it could be at home, it could be at work, it could be again on the global stage -- don't cut yourself off from thinking about something beyond technology as a fix because we're more concerned about technological evolution right now than we are about moral evolution. 
So I had to stand aside, while the others were filing toward the helicopter. 
Ostensibly, he's dead now. 
You also see -- and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings -- that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well-educated countries, and poor and badly-educated ones, a very, very important lesson. 
That means if we want the United States to stop feeling exhausted from trying to solve an impossible problem, we're going to need a lot more infrastructure. 
Some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis, which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it. 
Beau Lotto: "What are you reading?" Half the letters are missing, right? 
Or, absent crisis, we need to see that the hollowing out, the inequality, the challenges that are growing and growing in the United States, are themselves urgent enough to force our leaders to change, and that we have those voices. 
So Milgram is quantifying evil as the willingness of people to blindly obey authority, to go all the way to 450 volts. 
One where we're doing quite well, one where we really should be doing better and another where we've got some real problems. 
Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD. 
When I first got sick, old friends were reaching out to me. 
By the way, he gave the "I have a dream" speech, not the "I have a plan" speech. 
And now we think nothing of calling all over the world. 
I mean, a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean. 
We go to Craig and we check into a hotel, and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work. 
So Bell employed an engineer to study those noises, to try and find out where they came from, with a view towards building the perfect hardware codec, which would get rid of them so they could think about using radio for the purposes of telephony. 
But I also became interested in research, and in particular I became interested in this substance, nitric oxide. 
Gas was invented in 1600 by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont. 
Well, reducing the market is really one for governments and civil society. We've got to show we're better. 
My parents divorced when I was four months old. 
Now, if I'm being honest with you, my first inclination was to politely decline. 
Throughout the animal kingdom, genitalia are very complex things, much more complicated than seems necessary for what they're meant to do. 
Well, this one female came up to him. 
And when I went to find out something, I used scientific methods. I wasn't real surprised, you know, when they first told me how -- how you were supposed to do science, because I'd already been doing it for fun and whatever. 
Now, I don't know how many people here are familiar with the term "mensch." 
In technology, we spend so much time experimenting, fine-tuning, getting the absolute cheapest way to do something, so why aren't we doing that with social policy? 
And this is an important piece of the puzzle that many young designers may not think about when they're first starting their careers, but hiring a plus-size or a transgender photographer, or a woman of color as your casting director, or a black makeup artist -- hey, Fatima Thomas -- who intimately understands how important it is to be able to work with all skin tones: it's essential to creating a holistically inclusive output, like this one. 
But we still need to bring a lot of people along with us. 
Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. 
The surge was terrible. 
And again, when you are the president of this country and you say things, it also gives leaders in other undemocratic countries the cover to affront us even worse, and to really whack us -- and their own journalists -- with this bludgeon of fake news. 
They want us to optimize ourselves to fit in. 
We're going to voyage to some of these special places that we've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care. 
So when I look at a film, here's what we look for: We look for a story on the plot level, then we look for a story on the psychological level, then we look for a story on the political level, then we look at a story on a mythological level. 
More than you might think. 
There is no day in history, special calendar entry for all the people who failed to climb Mt. Everest before Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay made it to the top. 
Nancy might want to disconnect, but then she'd be worried: What if I'm missing something important? 
In the desert, operating costs are high because water is scarce, and the seed-eating ants that I study in the desert have to spend water to get water. 
GG: Yeah, it sounds completely different. 
You don't have to ask permission, as you do in a property-based system. 
When you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking, listening, you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie. 
But essentially, this is a big problem. 
I started thinking about the relationship between communication, media and collective action when I wrote "Smart Mobs," and I found that when I finished the book, I kept thinking about it. 
And large-scale has meant destruction of many of our landscapes, destruction of biodiversity -- still a lonely emu here in the Brazilian cerrado soybean fields. 
"They told us our legs would hurt, and they do. So what?" 
It's very, very epic and a very beautiful concert. 
And I said, "One word; Hummus." 
This is considered the Five Blessings. 
Our cyber civil rights are at stake. 
Then they proceeded to tell me that every year. 
Now, let's do it in a different order. 
We believe in human recommendations over algorithms. 
In fact, the world "cultus" originally described people who cultivated the worship of certain gods by performing rituals and maintaining temples. 
So one of the things that I say to men, and my colleagues and I always say this, is we need more men who have the courage and the strength to start standing up and saying some of this stuff, and standing with women and not against them and pretending that somehow this is a battle between the sexes and other kinds of nonsense. 
The thing that is exciting was, in 1976, I suddenly got interested in the human-powered airplane because I'd made a made a loan to a friend of 100,000 dollars, or I guaranteed the money at the bank. 
Who did you tell after the event? 
(Applause) Ninety percent of our patients have Medicaid, and most of the rest, we see for free. 
That would power the US for hundreds of years. 
The premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared. 
Women in low-income neighborhoods are picked up and charged with prostitution, regardless of what they actually do for a living. 
Here's what they said: "We find that financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance." 
If you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it, the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory. 
So, this sort of recapitulates what I was telling you about development. 
When I interviewed my informants from the upper classes, they all said the same thing: "Life in Scandinavia is tough." 
Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon. 
But then I'd put my blinders back on, I'd get back out there, do my thing, but in the process of doing that, I developed this -- angry, grumpy demeanor. 
Now, successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field. 
And I'd never fallen on it, never. 
Let's not forget these men, who are truly dying to work. 
When you empower a girl, you transform a community. 
They have more economic opportunities -- applaud. 
E: Goodbye. 
We could, of course, buy more efficiency. 
He's dying. 
So I promised myself, the next time, I would say something. 
After the hour was up, I rolled down my window, and I checked for mama grizzly. 
And I believe in a pluralistic society, everybody's betting on something. 
For them, choice was not just a way of defining and asserting their individuality, but a way to create community and harmony by deferring to the choices of people whom they trusted and respected. 
So, I added these protocells together to the system, and protocell A and protocell B fused together to form a hybrid protocell AB. 
I caddied at the time, earned about five dollars a bag. 
And of course, we want to sterilize mostly when there are people around. 
So the question I want to leave you with is: What do you most yearn for? 
(Laughter) The FDA estimates that of all the Americans who have tattoos, 17 percent of us regret getting them. 
He’s a particularly promising student, but he was admitted to study because Peseshet is a scribe, as was her father before her. 
First of all, people noticed that the Earth was below, the sky above, and both the Sun and the Moon seemed to go around them. 
But a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being touched in the same location. 
Me too, every day. 
Michael's dad was working on something called the computer. 
And we have shifted it to a model of free choice and individual rights, and self-fulfillment and happiness. 
Lauren embarks on a quest with a group of refugees to find a place to thrive. 
I would like to do a short test with you. 
That is an all-pervasive problem, because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer, for instance, wants to cheat women, they can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of God, why should I treat them as equals myself? 
I’d lectured on the Mexican-American War. 
And maybe it's because of the funding. 
So to those who despair that the Paris Climate Accord didn't go far enough or that your limited actions on their own won't solve global warming, I say don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. 
Maybe my experience with the WWE wasn't ideal. 
The rule of thumb was that, if my mother couldn't understand it, then we couldn't use it in the video. 
I knew of Roxbury as an impoverished neighborhood in Boston, plagued by gun violence and drug crime. 
So imagine your domestic robot's at home. 
And in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams, one team on each side of the playground, and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires. 
It's frankly more memorable than all those millions of hotels we've all stayed at that tell you that your room has actually been recently renovated at a cost of 500,000 dollars, in order to make it resemble every other hotel room you've ever stayed in in the entire course of your life. 
There's a guy on Twitter that I know, a health IT guy outside Boston, and he wrote the e-Patient rap. 
Most students think that it's boring or unwelcoming, so I have always designed projects following three principles. 
In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online. 
And then I took her home and lathered her up in the shower and massaged her scalp and I dried her off in a towel. 
Above 30,000 feet up to nearly 50,000 feet, you need pressure breathing, which is where you're wearing a G suit.

(Laughter) Well, her colleague suddenly got much more interested than I had any right to expect and went on and said, "What does he model?" 
So you have living dinosaurs and space aliens, animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions. 
Let me tell you about some of them. 
I had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger, and now Melinda, and in even stronger, equal ways, is the partner, so we talk a lot about which things should we give more to, which groups are working well? 
Because in other places, you can have interruptions like the TV, or you could go for a walk, or there's a fridge downstairs, or you've got your own couch, or whatever you want to do. 
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis. 
Now, that brings us full circle. 
So over the next few months, we made a committee called Students for a Healthy Oregon, and we set out to end the stigma against mental health. 
(Laughter) Now, in that little tube, I have, actually, a very common spider. 
Some people were helpful. 
What you may not have realized is that English is actually an outlier. 
Number three, the 99 stones all have within them a mechanism that self-updates. 
What's more, we're seeing a dramatic reduction in homicide. 
What will you do? 
Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power. 
It's made up of 16 concentric shells. Each one has 92 spheres. 
And some psychologists will tell you the answer can be found in therapy. 
Those things really exist. 
And yet, compromise, consensus, that is what I believe in. 
But, in 10 or 15 machine generations they will, and these are machine generations, not human generations. 
So it's not multi-touch as a whole that's patented. 
I didn't. 
Basically, the model showed that if we could get free trade, and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe, we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year, half of which would accrue to the Third World. 
(Laughter) "Give me a break." 
Even families can be split apart by fear of Ebola, too. 
Half of the world's population lives in countries that are already above that line. 
What this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat. 
So I have a couple minutes. 
Others think it's too many refined grains and starches. 
And it stays that size until the queen dies and there's nobody to make more ants, when she's about 15 or 20 years old. 
CA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. 
There's an enormous amount of anatomical variation. 
It has no nutritional value, so they don't feed it to the animals. 
Was it just a massive waste of time? 
It's particularly horrible in LA. 
And I hear very often questions phrased in different ways. 
They argue that it doesn't reveal anything because its premise is so unrealistic that study participants don't take it seriously. 
And it's the size of this telescope, the fact that we've built it over the entire desert that gives us a better resolution than Parkes. 
So far, I've only talked about what's happening in the listener's brain, in your brain, when you're listening to talks. 
It was essentially India being itself. 
It all suddenly became much more about our human nature and our curiosity, rather than technology. 
These are not opposing qualities. 
I'm calling this The Great Unwind. 
And you can look at what a wet meadow needs. 
It's supposed to last for many years, but if the ink that we use has been absorbed with oxygen and moisture [which] are not being removed, then we can quickly see dark spots appear in the pixels. 
It could have been Sean Bell. 
But this is not just about them. 
Scientists, pure mathematicians among them, follow one or the other of two pathways: First through early discoveries, a problem is identified and a solution is sought. 
And in uncovering viruses, Beijerinck really opened this entirely new world for us. 
But, that's maybe just one coincidence. 
So we see the galaxy and fixate on that, but it's actually a cloud of dark matter that's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy. 
So in 1997 we got all these incredible women together and we said, "How can we use the play, this energy, to stop violence against women?" 
It grows different structures on each side, eventually turning into the familiar asymmetric heart. 
Could we fly through them to find out? 
We only think about them when they go wrong, so, when there's a broken arm, or when you have a heart attack, then you become really very aware of your bodies. 
Not a single one. 
So it also has the ability, all the time, regardless of the direction of the wind, to be able to make the building fresh and efficient. 
As humans, it's in our nature to want to improve our health and minimize our suffering. 
Enigma number one: How do you create jobs in America in a global economy? 
So he sent a letter back to John saying, "It turns out you can generate these patterns using prime number theory." 
In cohousing, you have your own home, but you also share significant spaces, both indoors and out. 
So I found myself, in other words, constructing a geometry, a geometry of things which had no geometry. 
In the beginning, the system is disorganized. 
I mean, this is something that our studio has been working on for the past decade. 
The typical one that I was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a Predator strike taking out an enemy site. Missile hits, bodies burst into the air with the explosion. 
Maybe we needed to assumption-bust, to ask a different kind of question -- about duration, for instance. 
We set out a clear action plan with goals and benchmarks. 
And I say to you, "Remember that there is a guy who is a baker." 
His name is Brandon Marrocco. 
Well, when we take a look at this from the computer simulation into real life, we can see with this 3D model that I built over here, essentially using 3D printing, we can see those same airflow patterns coming down, right to the passengers. 
He's managed to grab a tip of these worms. 
This is in part because they're doing important work in interesting places. 
I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards, just like this. 
But if God can or will do these things -- intervene to change the flow of events -- then surely he could have stopped the tsunami. 
This experience changed our lives, and now we're trying to change the experience. 
Throughout this time, I also studied many laws, I talked to many people, I read up on many cases, and I found that the lack of justness is not just a problem in Afghanistan, but it's a global problem. 
We've got to get out of here." 
(Laughter) I was pretty good in reading, but religion and musical appreciation needed more work. 
But the suggestion I want to put to you today is that there's something fundamentally wrong with this model. 
And if you plot a data point for these same two dozen sports today, it looks like this. 
So, here we go: a flyby of play. 
So a colleague of mine from nursing called Lisa Shaw and I went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes in the medical records department looking at whether there was any sign at all that anybody had had any conversation about what might happen to them if the treatment they were receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die. 
However, inclusivity means nothing if it's only surface level. 
There are some hard problems that have to be dealt with: Al-Qaeda, ISIS -- they remain dangerous threats. 
But that's changed. 
Now, I do understand that companies are under a lot of short-term earnings pressures. 
We now have a platform. 
It's twice the range of any electric motorcycle. 
We're a visual species. When scientists first realized that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night, we didn't believe it. 
So these things are really getting better very quickly. 
Again, we can't know, but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved. 
Man 2: Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand. 
No matter how many difficult feelings there were, he turned toward them with kindness and compassion. 
Venus and Mars don't have that. 
One afternoon she was lying on her back, and she arched her back on the carpet stuck her tongue out of the side of her mouth and managed to torque her body onto her belly. 
People are worried that technology is going to steal our jobs, but when it comes to community health workers, technology has actually been vital for creating jobs. 
Even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid. 
And it's a story that did work. It did happen, and the machines are all around us. 
I think there's an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is HIV-positive, she's going to infect her child. 
So the list of ingredients does tell you something, and sometimes it tells you something that's wrong. 
IDA was so moved by people's response, they named it "Hope Hospital." 
The problem becomes: who gets what data when? 
For the next few minutes, the blob is sleeping in its obtuse triangle form. 
Now if you had to pick a sense to lose, I have to be very honest with you and say, we're better at restoring hearing than we are at restoring any sense that there is. 
If you look at Gojek today, nine out of 10 previous motor taxi drivers believe their quality of life has improved after joining the platform. 
The economy ran out of jobs. 
First it would establish education as a fundamental human right, where anyone around the world with the ability and the motivation could get the skills that they need to make a better life for themselves, their families and their communities. 
So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave. 
And look at the position of the old West. 
He said they were in the business of selling nicotine. 
And the idea that a city group can maintain different types of foliage is really quite exceptional. 
And so it came to me in waves. 
LB: I think fear, political incompetence, interference, not taking it seriously soon enough -- it's pretty human. 
There are 10,000 species of ants that taxonomists -- people who describe and name animals -- have named. 
(Mosquito buzzing, lower pitch) GG: Wow. 
Shimon Schocken: Right, but I like myself. 
What if your main revenue stream were to dry up overnight? 
So I pause, waiting for her directions. 
One billion. 
And when we do that what we discovered is that the circuitry does change. 
So we're going to bring you to them. 
For example, you can use the verb "go" and the prepositions "to" and "from" in a literal, spatial sense. 
And, in fact, the equations that make neurons into electrical generators were discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates. 
I had never thought about insects living in complex societies. 
Illness is universal; access to care is not. 
And this right here is a shoe last -- those are those cast-iron things you see at antique shops. 
I left Ireland yesterday morning. 
You get more money because your terms of trade have improved, but also that drives up output across the board. 
And in 1759, he described to his grandson various things he was seeing. 
So my cofounders and I set out to create that language. 
Straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process. 
Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs? 
But then we moved. 
(Laughter) Yes, leaving me once again alone. 
And when it finds one of those phrases, it grabs the sentence up to the period, and then automatically tries to deduce the age, gender and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence. 
However, there would be one major side effect: if we replaced elections with sortition and made our parliament truly representative of society, it would mean the end of politicians. 
But it was not the first time I've been humbled by a student's question. 
So I think it's critically important for even people of color to realize they have the power to resist, and when people of color view other people of color as the problem, they're not going to view racism as the problem. 
EM: I think there's no real length limit. 
But maybe, if you join me in creating, curating and commissioning more AfroBubbleGum art, there might be hope for a different view of the world, a happy Africa view where children are strangely traumatized by their mother's dark sense of humor, (Laughter) but also they're claiming fun, fierce and frivolous art in the name of all things unseriously African. 
So, you can see that what we have on this axis here is size of family. One, two, three, four, five children per woman on this axis. 
For centuries, this was dismissed, but actually it's true. 
This year, they decided to extend the length of time and the area over which they're asking ships to slow down. 
Our Vice President of Operation kissing the board. Obviously very, very excited. 
So what's it like to be a baby? 
And then, on top of it you add: "And thousands of young people from Athens, Madrid and New York will demonstrate for social justice, claiming they are inspired by Arabs." 
But it may be even bigger than that, because our unmanned systems don't just affect the "how" of war-fighting, they affect the "who" of fighting at its most fundamental level. 
(Applause) DB: It's like you're racing through it. 
I couldn't tell what those ones and zeros represented. 
A few years ago, I was thinking about this, and I went to "The Sunday Sport," a tabloid newspaper I don't recommend you start reading if you're not familiar with it already. 
In fear, the upper white of the eyes are revealed as the eyebrows raise and the mouth stretches open, while surprise looks similar, but with rounded eyebrows and relaxed lips. 
So here, I'm using a rendering algorithm to paint the frequencies of the song "Smells Like Teen Spirit" in a way that the eyes can take them in as a single visual impression, and the technique will also show the strengths of the visual cortex for pattern recognition. 
Sounds like a great idea, but how do you make it real? 
Either way, by the way, if you think it's hard for traditional families to sort out these new roles, just imagine what it's like now for non-traditional families: families with two dads, families with two moms, single-parent households. 
We've got to practice what we preach. 
Now, when we do think about the future, we tend to focus on predicting exactly what's next, whether we're using horoscopes or algorithms to do that. 
We're also the subject of an award-winning research paper called "Appropriating Minecraft as an Assistive Technology for Youth with Autism." 
This may not surprise you, since everyone now has digital books in their tablets in 2015. 
Which I used to think meant Not Entirely Dead. 
This guy is no Republican. 
We're visiting ancient Rome to watch the Liberalia, an annual festival that celebrates the liberty of Rome's citizens. 
If you can get something to about 150 million degrees, things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration, this will happen, and it will release energy. 
Up, up, higher and higher they flew, across land, across oceans they sped. 
But what we've also discovered is that a physiological signature of aging is that your sleep gets worse, especially that deep quality of sleep that I was just discussing. 
So the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rat's in. 
No, because at that time, education was banned for girls, completely. 
You know, sometimes there's a 10-, 15-minute break out there when you're waiting for a wave to come in. 
But it was around this time that I began to realize mental health was much a bigger problem than just for me personally. 
As a Nigerian American, I know how easily the term "African" can slip from being an ordinary geographic descriptor to becoming a pejorative. 
Actually, what happens in the world increasingly -- now, all credit to the British Airport Authority. 
My father was a professor. 
It's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated. 
Young people, I think, my Harvard Business School students, are getting it. 
"For homeless people?" 
We need that in the world. 
You know, most people who engage in corruption know they shouldn't. 
Here's that infant with what's called microcephaly. 
But the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women, illiterate women, who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker. 
Like I said, Shanghai and Copenhagen are both port cities, but in Copenhagen the water has gotten so clean that you can actually swim in it. 
This is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment. 
One of the four boxes was sealed incorrectly, but they lost track of which one. 
Do I tell her about our bodies, how they are 60 percent water, but we still burn like driftwood, making fuel of our sacrifice? 
There have been at least 33 versions of hominids that have walked around this Earth. 
Anything I don't understand, where I have to make the leap myself, in my own head, will stop the flow of the presentation. 
(Laughter) There is no evidence that getting up early and going to bed early gives you more wealth at all. 
So I took the husbands along. 
She was 80, almost that day of the interview, and there she was and there I was, and I just proceeded into the questions. 
And it was late, it was nearly midnight, we'd gotten into an argument over dinner, and when we got back to our room, he threw his things in the bag and stormed out. 
And you buy one, and maybe you get a real piece, and maybe not. 
But even in the middle of this civil war, Moses hangs on to this idea that architecture can be a way to bridge communities back together. 
Well, I hope to change that in less than three minutes. 
Instead, the cause was likely environmental— improved education, better healthcare, and better nutrition. 
I want to introduce you to James Cavitt. 
I was about fourteen, we were at his house, arguing. 
The provocation in that case was the assassination of a second-level figure, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which then led the Austro-Hungarian emperor to issue an ultimatum to Serbia, they dragged in the various allies, within two months, all of Europe was at war. 
The study ended after six days, because it was out of control. 
Over the course of human history, starvation has been a much bigger problem than overeating. 
We know that solutions are available today. 
But it's already the most portable and the most likely to impact our everyday lives. 
It's a process by which technologists hide ugly truths inside black box algorithms and call them objective; call them meritocratic. 
That's a terrible toll, but the vast majority were people of Muslim heritage, killed by Muslim fundamentalists. 
Education wasn't about getting jobs. 
But every now and then, a point mutation disrupts an important capability in a cell or causes a cell to misbehave in harmful ways. 
Our brains aren't invincible. 
So the first disease he looked at is autism. 
Today, most Indian cities and much of rural India have no air quality monitoring at all. 
Number five, one of my favorites: reversal of the Earth's magnetic field. 
If you take the 10 countries that went on to become the Western empires, in 1500 they were really quite tiny -- five percent of the world's land surface, 16 percent of its population, maybe 20 percent of its income. 
They believe they can rely on their families, so that makes them more likely to take certain risks. 
And we're going to focus on the most important meal of the day, breakfast. 
Who have you ever known who woke up in the morning -- (Laughter) -- that turned black? 
So think about that again when we think that we are different. 
And we've watched as the tools we uniquely make to pull the resources out of our environment kind of just blow up in our face. 
But as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos. 
We'll say big-boned. 
There are now studies clearly showing that the wars are terrible, that rapes are terrible, but this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa. 
And it took over a decade to clear their names. 
As it turns out, there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village. 
What species of primate do you think is even more divergent from the wild primates than the captive primates? 
So of course whatever you don't really do yourself doesn't really get done properly. 
And I said, "Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in DNA?" 
Although I won't be able to show you a real picture of a black hole today, I'd like to give you a brief glimpse into the effort involved in getting that first picture. 
Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells, and this is why it seems as if it is so rare. 
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H M, or the next Steven Meisel. 
One of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus. 
You ask me now if I miss it, and I will tell you I am still there. 
If that doctor treats that male with the correct pronouns, correct name, gives dignity and respect, it's highly likely that the rest of the staff will too. 
And so for the remaining two years of my high school, I cut all my classes. 
Later, when I took my cousin to school, I was usually taken for the nanny. 
KB: Besides, who's next, no, OK. 
We start the meeting. 
I'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass. 
What if doctors were to become totally transparent with their patients? 
Isn't that all hate? 
Earth’s crust is made from several vast, jagged slabs of rock called tectonic plates, each riding on a hot, partially molten layer of Earth’s mantle. 
Then he went home. 
One way to get more women into leadership is to have other women mentor them. 
Who the hell are you to accuse me of something like this?'" And I said, you know, "Look, you're absolutely right. 
So these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against expert clinical tests? We'll, they're both non-invasive. 
And of course, if we go to animals, they also have another basket -- another symphony of different kinds of intelligences, and sometimes those same instruments are the same that we have. 
So I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand. Yeah. 
China's building 300 new cities in the next 20 years. 
Work is not just something I do when I'd rather be doing something else. 
OK. Would you call me please right now? [Phone number given.] And don't you all call me at three a.m. asking me to fix your printer. 
I was drawn to dangerous men and women who I allowed -- actually, I invited -- to treat me badly, because that is what my father taught me love was. 
That's they call it -- "harvest," like it's some kind of bucolic farm-to-table event -- (Laughter) Which I can assure you it is not. 
And here's just one example. 
Republicans really dislike the Democrats. We're changing. 
You see, we were all outside when the contamination came down. 
So just as we were finishing these experiments, I was starting to write a book about originals, and I thought, "This is the perfect time to teach myself to procrastinate, while writing a chapter on procrastination." 
This idea, the effect that punishment can improve performance, was what participants thought they were testing in Milgram's famous learning and punishment experiment that you've probably heard about if you're a psychology student. 
You have to haul 1,000 pounds of equipment to the summit of this 20,000-foot volcano in the Andes here. 
It needed to know the exact distance, so he knew very precisely that the distance between the two cities was 500 miles. 
The captain was a captain of a sea-going ship. 
I can't wait to see what their experiment looks like, what their pilot project looks like, so we can start taking a collective approach nationally through the dignity of work. 
My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement, and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday. We're on the corner of 57th and 5th. 
It stretched from eastern Washington to western Montana, and it burned, in a few days, three million acres, devoured several towns, and it killed 87 people. 
But then the robots did this fiber winding, which was almost impossible for a human to do. 
He sealed the transcripts and placed them under a protective order in an attempt to prevent someone like me from doing something like this. 
It actually does. 
Three reasons. 
The nutritionist said I should eat root vegetables Said if I could get down 13 turnips a day I would be grounded, rooted. 
Fortunately, John Roebling's son, Washington, was also a trained engineer and took over his father’s role. 
I recently published this book that draws on multiple different strands of evidence to make the point that, in a competitive 21st century economy, what the market values is the ability to produce things that are rare and are valuable. 
It's based on the presumption, the observation even, that all important technologies go through four stages in their life -- at least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages. 
(Laughter). 
But the most important partner we need to engage is you, the American public, and indeed, the world public. 
We were exposed to harassment, exploitation, intimidation and discrimination. 
I have had so many versions of myself through my self-portraits that I've been many different characters. 
WK: In fact, a design of the windmill that was in the book, it has got four -- ah -- three blades, and mine has got four blades. 
So the same Guardian rebuts, "Are video games art: the debate that shouldn't be. 
Actually, they got much worse. 
Steve Grand, in his book, "Creation: Life and How to Make It," is positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter itself. 
I became art director of the china and glass industry, and eventually under Stalin's purges -- at the beginning of Stalin's purges, I didn't know that hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested. 
Or you could go out by yourself even to a half-block-long empty lot, into the bushes: like a creature of leaves you'd lurk, crouched, crawling, simplified, savage, alone; already there was wanting to be simpler, wanting, when they called you, never to go back. 
Cars are all wrong. 
This group of Russian government hackers hadn't just appeared out of nowhere in 2016. 
Now, global warming could have been a lot worse than it is. 
Or in a given row, treat each number as part of a decimal expansion. 
Now, that's for oral rehydration therapy. 
If it hits something -- you people see that? 
Nobody notices it. If you're not a flower, these bees do not care about you. (Laughter) They don't. They don't. They'll say, "S'cuse me, flying around." (Laughter) Some other images here in telling a part of the story that really made urban beekeeping terrific is in New York City, beekeeping was illegal until 2010. 
And the last point about the 99 Noor stones is this. 
And then there is social media, and what's happening on the Internet. 
And that's only if we launch on a very specific day, at a very specific time, once every two years, when Mars and the Earth are aligned just so, so the distance that the rocket would have to travel will be the shortest. 
But I hope that you'll go outside and see the world in a new way, to see all the amazing synchrony around us. Thank you. 
Now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see, Susana did a simple but brutally effective experiment. 
Space is a perfect environment for robogamis. 
The battery-powered Spyfish sends the live video-feed through a slender cable.) DK: This slender cable was a huge technological advancement and it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is. 
I said, "I want a pair of jeans. Here's my size." 
Second, and more important, keep learning. 
The problem is absolutely soluble, and even soluble in a way that's reasonably cheap. 
We don't make money at these damn shows. 
I mean, from there my treatment just when out of sight, because they were like, Kurt, explain this, explain this. 
After quitting my job, I decided to organize my friends to speak about the violence in the country, to speak about the state of the nation, and June 1, 2009 was the day that we were meant to go to the stadium and try and get the president's attention. 
Even the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act, designing a prototype phone that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs. 
That's how it works. That's why we don't see the long lifespan, until we have the daf-2 mutant. 
Suffice to say though, as far as I'm concerned, without question, the most bizarre designs and outrageous behaviors are in the animals that live in the mid-water community. 
Today, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning, and he's flying to LAX, right now he's over Ohio. 
"It's really not the whole world I can change." 
We say to ourselves, "Maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something." 
But instead, I say that we should remember Lot's wife. 
This whole quest led me to this little girl. 
The other thing that I think is really important: A lot of national security policy isn't just about foreign policy, but it's about budgets, military budgets, and how the debts of countries work out. 
The difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment. 
And these are very exciting research areas, but it's really, really hard. 
There is a great deal of poverty. 
And we were only 11 years old, so it was not appropriate. (Laughter) But [German]. 
So he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space, not three, and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves in that fourth dimension. Now here's the thing: when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves in a universe with four space dimensions, not three, he found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions -- those were for gravity -- but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension. 
The goal of this stage is to find a safe way to introduce our immune system to the virus or bacteria. 
The cells grow out from the matrix, emerging from the skin where they die and harden into a water-resistant sheath. 
Then he turned to us and said, "That's the first time I've felt that shape in eight years." 
Every year, the federal government spends 60 billion dollars on research. 
Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated. Uncertainty is what makes play fun. 
Now, higher energy is important because for particles, there is an equivalence between energy and particle mass, and mass is just a number put there by nature. 
And as a consequence of this disagreement, it's very, very difficult for anyone to say, "I have the right version of Islam." 
It's also important to know that phages are extremely selective hunters. 
In response, engineers had a wild idea. 
People got very mad: "How can you charge such high fees?" 
Since then, new information about the Martian atmosphere, improved spacecraft technology, and more powerful computer simulations have drastically reduced uncertainty. 
What secrets do its pages contain? 
I enjoyed myself, but during that moment while I was here, I discovered a lot of things. 
That, by the way, in case you're paying attention, is not emotionally correct. 
And my father said, "Why don't you just go to school?" 
Celebrate them. 
Has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much that you kind of hated them briefly"? 
Local humanitarians have the courage to persist, to dust themselves off from the wreckage and to start again, risking their lives to save others.

And because the engineers that I've worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd, I want to summarize with an equation. (Laughter) Take your science, subtract your bullet points and your jargon, divide by relevance, meaning share what's relevant to the audience, and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you're doing, and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding. 
In fact, a year earlier, a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed.

Audience: EPC! 
So this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this, and we're looking very hard at how to make it highly cost-effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world. 
I started taking that into the realm of landscape, which is something that's almost a picture of nothing.

The United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world. 
I'm not saying that doctors are bad or evil. 
Within a short while, I think there's going to be a new field called "Combinatorial Genomics," because with these new synthesis capabilities, these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination, we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day.

In Yellowstone National Park, we killed every single wolf. 
I want to show you the one who really changed my life, and this was the performance in MoMa, which I just recently made.

How about bed nets? 
(Laughter) It's in your gift bag. No, no. 
Now, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this, which is also -- this place, this arena, which is built like a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also. 
(Whirring) All right. 
This was the choice facing those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts between February 1692 and May 1693.

HP: (In Chinese) YR: I was born and raised near Manchester, in England, but I'm not going to say it in English to you, because I'm trying to avoid any assumptions that might be made from my northern accent. 
And I thought, well, who painted this joyful, youthful figure? 
I was blown away by the natural beauty of the landscape, but most importantly, I couldn't believe we were finding perfect waves in such a remote and rugged part of the world. 
And that's what I try to do through mathematical modeling applied to biology, and in particular, to the development of drugs. 
He would even wake up sometimes at night wanting to scratch his lost feet. 
Heaven forbid. 
CA: No. That was wickedly clever, wickedly clever. 
Trees act like a natural sponge, absorbing storm water runoff before releasing it back into the atmosphere.

So how on earth was I going to read the world? 
Really, the possibilities are open. 
For 50 years, environmentalists, global health experts and animal activists have been begging the public to eat less meat. 
It works pretty good. 
Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI, whereas oxyhemoglobin can't. 
But with this amazing access, we allowed for a separation between creator and consumer, and the relationship between the two became much more one-way. 
Now in most parts of the world, the water's pretty murky, so it's very hard to observe animals underwater, but I found a community of dolphins that live in these beautiful, clear, shallow sandbanks of the Bahamas which are just east of Florida. 
Vulnerability is not weakness. 
JM: Now you can actually look at the distribution of suppression indexes over whole populations. 
CA: And so you added all these other remarkable series, "Narcos," "Jessica Jones," "Orange is the New Black," "The Crown," "Black Mirror" -- personal favorite -- "Stranger Things" and so on. 
So, one of these examples would of course be the historic city of Venice. 
Otherwise, dissent and investigative journalism are going to become even more difficult in even more places. 
Many mathematicians over the centuries tried to prove the parallel postulate from the other four, but weren't able to do so.

It's different from place to place. 
And so, the obvious avenue for bio-remediation comes from organisms like this. 
So I call this "from South Bronx to Southampton." 
And because of celebritification or whatever, if you're not rich or famous, you feel invisible. 
What would be the price? 
And this can be achieved by our generation. 
So let me ask for a show of hands. 
And if we take inspiration from the successes and lessons from the failures, we can keep the next potential pandemic so contained that our children’s children won’t even know its name. 
It would lose some of the magic that we had learned about that if you go somewhere and you spend time there, you can let the project grow organically and have a life of its own. 
I would have run away but I was too weak, a trick you taught me while I was learning to sit and heel and, greatest of insults, shake hands without a hand.

And he's shown here with his favorite high school teacher. 
The leader was everyone on that page. 
And that is super easy to do when you're around people who are like you.

I drove to the mall, bought a present, gave it to my mom." 
The street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it: To spatially denote the pedestrian realm, to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway, to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk, and to soften the hardscape of the buildings and to create a ceiling -- a vaulted ceiling -- over the street, at its best. 
Now, if you are an inexperienced gardener, the first thing you'll do when you visit the garden is to uproot this plant because it's dead. 
It depends on who produced it and how, in every single instance.

When you come back to the shore and you say, "We had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation, and the this and the that, all the technology of it, and the difficulty, the human-performance aspects of working at sea," you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that maybe cops have, or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it.

I don't want another "me too" product. 
So I responded to it in this piece called, "Implant." 
The time scale on which TED operates is just fantastic after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines.

The exact converse is also true. 
(Applause) Idiots. A couple of years ago, Broward County, Florida, banned running at recess. 
My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die. 
"That's a great idea" or "That's a terrible idea." 
What I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders, diseases of the mind. 
And those who shunned politics, well, they were idiots. 
And becoming Cowboy Gator Magraw is what got me there. 
And in the context of particular courses, you can ask questions like, what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them? 
And in the 20th century, medical anthropologists, like Arthur Kleinman, gathered evidence from the way people talk about pain to suggest that emotions aren't universal at all, and that culture, particularly the way we use language, can influence how we feel. 
We truly believe this will be the very first running humanoid robot in the United States. 
But even with what we've learned so far, we can see that by thinking carefully and by focusing on those problems that are big, solvable and neglected, we can make a truly tremendous difference to the world for thousands of years to come. 
We would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities. 
Xoquauhtli takes a few drops of water from a jade bowl, breaths on them, and places them on the baby’s tiny tongue. 
The American Civil War had ended a few years prior, but a couple of Union officers had witnessed some pretty shoddy marksmanship on the battlefield. 
So I'm a social scientist by training, so why am I here today talking about smart materials? 
There was some great response. 
But it turns out that sound also produces visual motions. 
There's all sorts of wonderful cases of species which -- in that case -- A parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat. 
We are the first generation which is in a position to do this. 
(Laughter) I also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions, and I still have that workbook. 
Anticipation made them happy. 
She imagined her father killing her on one hand, and Mama Agnes greeting her, with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house. 
Prosecutor: It takes two to make an heir, your honor. 
Not only did he get me one, but I had to get two. 
The second thing to notice is that for poor countries, the curve is really steep. 
And I swoosh from building to building on his way there 'cause I know where he lives. 
The Met was set up not as a museum of American art, but of an encyclopedic museum, and today, 140 years later, that vision is as prescient as ever, because, of course, we live in a world of crisis, of challenge, and we're exposed to it through the 24/7 newsreels. 
I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit. 
So I'm not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot, but a pot in a meadow. 
This is our responsibility. 
Writing under the pen name “Iola,” by the early 1890s she gained a reputation as a clear voice against racial injustice and become co-owner and editor of the Memphis Free Speech and Headlight newspaper. 
So in my lab we work on bumblebees, because we can completely control their experience, and see how it alters the architecture of their brain. 
I want to encourage people to create a list of contacts that they will work with and support as they take their first steps into the fickle and often challenging creative world. 
And never has infidelity exacted such a psychological toll. 
So we need to emphasize the transaction a little bit more. 
(Laughter) Every building has a fountain. 
Thank you, all of you. 
Now, 100 percent of their time is. 
And "conquilla," shells, and of course, they look like shells. 
I would like to think, as his father -- and he lives with me primarily -- that I had a little something to do with all of that. 
But like Leo Frobenius, a fellow German anthropologist who speculated some years later, upon seeing the Nigerian Ife Heads for the very first time, that they must have been artifacts from the long-lost kingdom of Atlantis. 
Will you? 
But why do these gases absorb specific colors of light? 
So they're over there, they're far away. 
I do believe that the disruptive technologies like stem cells that I've tried to explain to you do offer very real hope. 
I'm fascinated by graffiti. 
So I have a lot of progressive friends, including Joan. 
She recently returned to Dongguan on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes, temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village. 
This is not some Age of Aquarius, or Kumbaya statement, this is what a pandemic forces us to realize. 
I wish for you to help build a social movement of more than one million American activists for Africa. 
It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress, and it makes it unexpected, and that's what elicits a laugh. 
We reconditioned them all, fixed them. 
Well, here are the worrying facts. 
You may not realize this, but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy. 
For me, they share a fundamental problem: they're too slow. 
We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. 
Or maybe "all of the above" is too easy, and this is not an easy problem. 
I love this planet, I really do. 
If you have never seen a truly dark night sky, I want you to go out and experience one for yourself. 
So with simple electronics, you can detect how much the page is being bent. 
I know what these kids deserve on the healthcare side. 
There, you really did see the intelligence of the Web manifest itself. 
I'm not kidding you. The message said, "Was walking along the street" and "sky was blue" and "emergency"! 
So to say that you don't use social media should not be a large social stance, it's just rejecting one form of entertainment for others. 
And as you will see, the answer is not what we expect. 
In case you can't tell, that's, like, pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes. 
He has a 4.0. 
And here's Lincoln Meadow before selective logging. 
The lessons for us are three-fold. 
Well, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data, and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I ask with Track Your Happiness. Remember, this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives. 
I was really underpriced relative to the value I was delivering. 
Throw a drug at it, and resistant cells will grow back. 
It's one I'm wearing and one that's on exhibition at the Center for Books Arts in New York City. 
Especially at night, when commuters make these arteries look dramatically red and golden: the city's vascular system performing its vital function right before your eyes. 
They look like they're frozen in some embrace. 
Mr. President, thank you so much. 
And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves that tune in, turn on, drop out thoughts, perceptions, feelings and memories. 
The reason I have this picture here, this X-ray, it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays. 
Or we'll be in the kitchen cooking, road trips, airports. 
I was offered a position as associate professor of medicine and chief of scientific visualization at Yale University in the department of medicine. 
She said, "It's got color. It's got motion. 
And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address, where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial. 
Would I be forced to leave work? 
Let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice." 
I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world. 
A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other, and informally. 
And now, well, now, we're owned by Russia, so -- (Laughter) In a rendering by Barry Blitt here, Eustace has become Eustace Vladimirovich Tilley. 
MR: Thank you. 
(Applause) So you don't need the greatest technology to do things that can work in movies. 
Of all my sculptures, it's the most talkative. 
Part of the problem, of course, is just a lack of information. 
In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach. 
And research backs up that that really matters. 
(Applause) Thank you, thank you. 
"And because of him, millions of Native Americans aren't here today. 
Put your hands up. 
(Applause) Girls' and women's voices, and our allies' voices are constrained in ways that are personally, economically, professionally and politically damaging. 
We feel it to the very end. 
Especially when they're upside down, you're engaging that general facial recognition software there. 
How many ancient mariners have had a bad day? The number's a million. 
Thus, unless a black hole continues to absorb additional matter and energy, it’ll evaporate particle by particle, at an excruciatingly slow rate. 
And we can look in the past to other elements of transformative science and see how they can basically go out of control and permeate society. 
In hyena societies, adult males are actually the lowest on the social scale. 
It's this small place. 
I mean, at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy, they did not abuse their power. 
Now all this data that we collected, all the images, all the raw images, all the transcriptions that we made and that sort of thing have been put online under a Creative Commons license for anyone to use for any commercial purpose. 
In the United Arab Emirates, the second-most water-scarce country in the world, officials designed what they called the "Business Heroes Toolkit" in 2010. 
Starting small is a wise thing to do. I would, too, if I were you." 
We're programmed to prioritize productivity. 
I have personally seen just how incredibly powerful those kinds of efforts can be around the world. 
I had never lived alone for any period of time, and I'd never slept with sea lions snoring next to me all night. 
What I'm talking about is giving women the power to save their lives, to save their children's lives and to give their families the best possible future. 
They get people into a fMRI scanner, and while they're lying there, through a tube, they get to sip wine. 
All of this modern technology is putting out strong signals that can completely swamp this exceedingly faint light we're trying to detect from the rest of the universe outside Earth, which just for the record, is most of the universe. 
In the US, only 15 percent of the total textile and garment waste that's generated each year ends up being donated or recycled in some way, which means that the other 85 percent of textile and garment waste end up in landfills every year. 
The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding. 
Then, there was more of a hump. 
Every individual has a role to play. 
Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end, but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention. 
It's not that they're cramming for some project. 
And now let's compare that with fish farming. 
So we focused on motion capture. 
This is six months of my life, into this file. 
And three hours later, what we see at the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitoes ... 
But the body does have its inherent evolved trajectories. 
At the moment, you only have empty computer graphics in games. 
My brother, sister and I, all three of us own companies as well. 
And so, in the Near Westside of Syracuse, New York, we started to run design workshops with the community to both locate and reenvision an old drug house to be a peacemaking center. 
And this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things. 
Space is also an infinite source of inspiration, through education, through research and astronomy and that age-old experience of stargazing. 
And then at the top, we have 30, which is a product of three prime numbers -- two times three times five. 
In Boulder, Colorado, voters not too long ago approved a process to replace the private power company, literally the power company, the electric company Xcel, with a publicly owned utility that would forego profits and attend far more to climate change. 
One semester, I was asked to sub for this Algebra 2 class. 
If we called valedictorian a "White Knight Paladin level 20," I think people would probably work a lot harder. 
My grandmother was a woman who took extraordinary pleasure in dressing up. 
In 1898, Norman Triplett did this study with a bunch of cyclists, and he would measure their times around the track in a group, and also individually. 
It doesn't surprise me that in this climate, many of our institutions for the provision of health care start to look a heck of a lot like Jiffy Lube. 
Now, when we think about what we [can] do in those first years, I can tell you, having been in this field for so long, one feels really rejuvenated. 
Because it's easy to figure out that once you didn't get what you wanted, then maybe you should have set your sights a little lower, but I'm here to tell you to be aggressive about your ambition. 
Very good. Okay. 
And he put me on anti-depressants. 
Who's going to click on "like?" 
These girls are also working in big construction companies like Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons. 
And he has been very happy. 
(Laughter) And I read her everything that I could, and we laughed, and we loved it, and it was the most important stage that I've ever stood on, surrounded by family, by remnants of a people who were given as a dowry to a relentless war but still managed to make pearls of this life; by the ones who taught me to not only laugh, but to live in the face of death; who placed their hands across the sky, measuring the distance to the sun and saying, "Smile; I'm gonna meet you there." 
Carbonated beverages can similarly bubble up in the stomach, forcing open the valve. 
Like, for instance, the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes because having all your fat in one place, like a, you know, fat backpack, means that you don't have to have that insulation all over the rest of your body. 
A lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student-to-teacher ratios. 
Earth, if we're lucky enough -- if it doesn't get hit by a Hale-Bopp, or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years -- we'll find under your feet. 
First of all, there aren't a lot of big inventions in the pipeline, and this is a big problem for human health, and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem, that they're about to fall off something called the patent cliff. 
This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through. 
And there you are. 
So it's only in the last 200 years that Europe took off, followed by North America. 
In fact, they don’t even need to know exactly who’s been visited… just how many people have been. 
Now this is a very well-observed and well-established notion for behavior change. 
(Laughter) And here, that's one of my favorites. 
I'm only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages right here. 
They would be investing billions of dollars in renewables. 
I mean there's the decorative, the dancing ... 
So that's when I started reading everything I could about psychoactive drugs: the history, the science, the politics, all of it, and the more one read, the more it hit you how a thoughtful, enlightened, intelligent approach took you over here, whereas the politics and laws of my country were taking you over here. 
They want to change the world. 
Not only in humans. 
But we're not seeing all the waves out there. 
Because if we want to measure our emotions and teach them in our schools and listen as our politicians tell us how important they are, then it is a good idea that we understand where the assumptions we have about them have come from, and whether they still truly speak to us now. 
Now, you can have strong opinions, disagree, have conflict or give negative feedback civilly, with respect. 
The acid rain was falling on the forests. 
There are some more primitive ways of pleasing one's partner. 
Just as a grandfather clock relies on the constant swinging back and forth of a pendulum under gravity, the tick tock of an atomic clock is maintained by the transition between two energy levels of an atom. 
So as you can see, the firing patterns from the blind animal treated with the encoder-transducer really do very closely match the normal firing patterns -- and it's not perfect, but it's pretty good -- and the blind animal treated with the standard prosthetic, the responses really don't. 
So if you look at security from economic terms, it's a trade-off. 
WhatsApp, which is now owned by Facebook and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world, also has built strong encryption technology into its product, which means that people in the Global South can easily communicate without their governments, often authoritarian, wiretapping their text messages. 
And that's really what I do as a writer, as a storyteller, is try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually help us think ecologically. 
However, we are often not aware of these noise-induced sleep disturbances, because we are unconscious while we're sleeping. 
You're so good at math, why don't you --" The kid interrupts you and says, "But it is my dream. It is my dream to do this." 
It's a reality now. 
Let me show you what I mean. 
It's buried treasure. 
Parents are very worried that this device is going to stunt their children's social growth; that it's going to keep them from getting up and moving; that somehow, this is going to disrupt childhood. 
I mean, Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today. 
So these are systems which are made up of many interconnected or interacting parts: swarms of birds or fish, ant colonies, ecosystems, brains, financial markets. 
Or to say, as Alan Greenspan did, "I know you think you understand what you thought I said, but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant." 
You know the words I mean? 
She said, "That's Wei. 
The exhibition was designed to be an experience, and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs. 
Let me say that again. 
Has the toilet been made, has the meal been served. 
She's got a lot of insight. 
When I am with my children, I try to leave work out of our lives. 
But, for 10 years, we tried to capture lions and elephants together -- and never ever managed until this particular night. 
There were factors pushing these two in one direction, but through tailored mentorship and opportunities, they were able to reflect on their circumstances and resist negative influences. 
With this job all I needed were my hands and my massage table by my side and I could go anywhere. 
Now I'd like to you to mentally answer the following questions. 
By the next year, they finally told me about an actual wrestling training camp that one of the wrestlers was running, and I begged my parents to sign me up. 
When I was in high school, I loved to program computers, so I sort of liked the logical flow of events. 
What is the effect? What's the consequence? 
And the answer is no. 
Warren Berger says that design thinking teaches us to look sideways, to reframe, to refine, to experiment and, probably most importantly, ask those stupid questions. 
The financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon, which has just accelerated this huge shift, which ends half a millennium of Western ascendancy. 
Here in New York, those are also the schools most likely to serve the one in 10 elementary school students who will most likely have to sleep in a homeless shelter tonight. 
The educational potential is there just waiting to be tapped by creative people like you. 
The tragedy of that protracted stagnation isn't sufficiently recognized, I think. 
And the flowing continues with consequences. 
While I was excited about the technology and how maybe we don't need to own cars anymore, she felt that every Uber car is here to steal jobs from taxi drivers. 
Because the data is hidden down in the databases. 
But it was great." 
She had the biggest increase in oxytocin. 
The storm was so fierce that we had to lay, fully dressed, fully equipped, laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain. 
Finally, the environmental argument is fascinating, because the environmentalists turned on a dime about 10 years ago. 
We threw white towels around their necks, stolen from the bathroom -- sorry -- played Rocky music on an iPad, got each a Don King-like manager to rev them up and prepare them with counterarguments, and then basically made them each argue the best possible argument of each future vision. 
When we go to make machines, we're going to engineer them in the same way, where we'll make some of those types of smartness much greater than ours, and many of them won't be anywhere near ours, because they're not needed. 
Ambient air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria and HIV/AIDS. 
So you get the idea here. 
(Applause) What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in. 
When it was clear that nobody in our generation wanted to take on the heavy burden of ranching, the ranch was sold to a neighbor. 
Because if it doesn't, the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed will be demonic, and they will destroy the European Union. 
To start, it helps to understand how this kind of memory works. 
It's got a brittle star hitching a ride. 
And in social, we're just figuring that out. 
And they expect these people who work for them to do great work -- I would hope, at least. 
And he said, "Oh, Rushkoff, you're just saying that because you're a human." 
That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl. 
And women from El Salvador to Ireland are fighting for reproductive rights. 
Young black people in America have been fighting, really fighting hard to get their stories told for centuries. 
So -- (Laughter) I really think that the network scales and operates a lot better as a ride-sharing platform, also because the integration with air-traffic management works a lot better if it's handled centrally. 
They were there in February, and it snowed a lot in February last year. 
(Laughter) We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined. 
So here's the thing: The current business model for language education is the student pays, and in particular, the student pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars. 
Over the course of my career, I've had the great honor playing some of the greatest male role models ever represented on television. 
Well, they do mix. 
And what was happening in the communities that I was serving is we were losing people every week to gun violence and mass incarceration. 
Now, why am I saying this? 
There's a certain amount of aristocracy. 
Why? Because they fail. 
You may be happy to know that your research will pay off. 
And escalating that conflict, Los Zetas said, "We will kill 10 people for every bit of information you release." 
And what I discovered is, because of the nature of the footage and the fact that we're doing this film, there was an emotion that was built into it and our collective memories of what this launch meant to us and all these various things. 
I was fully aware that for someone as secular as I am, just asking it could be seen as pure chutzpah. 
What we need is useful clarity, so just for fun, I redesigned this. 
When I was working in the field, I brought lots of candles with me, and with the help of my interpreter, I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight, so when it was safe for them, and safe for me, I made these images. 
You can protest, you can write letters to the editor, you can donate to and volunteer for causes, you can create art, you can create literature, you can create poetry and music, you can create a community that cares for one another and does not allow those atrocities to happen. 
Market-creating innovations transform complicated and expensive products into products that are simple and affordable, so that many more people in society could access them. 
It's a sextra-quadra-hexa-something or other." Right? 
We can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers, because we alone, of all the animals on the planet, can create and believe fictions, fictional stories. 
And we can just ask: "What are the names of Santa's reindeer?" and be told instantly -- or anything else we want to ask. 
But it's also, as you all know, a beautiful city encircled by hills, filled with more than 2,000 temples and shrines, where people have been sitting still for 800 years or more. 
Same with furniture, it's too utilitarian. 
But I didn't just want to paint the shadows. 
We're talking about popular TV. 
They don't take 30-minute hot showers every morning. 
And on these chromosomes are roughly 25,000 genes. 
Virtual reality bridges that gap. 
There's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this, if you want to convey the information to other people about virtual autopsies. 
RCA had David Sarnoff, who basically commercialized radio, said this, "I don't say that radio networks must die. 
Or a system where you grow up to 10 species next to each other -- off of each other, mimicking nature. 
As she handed me my porridge, I asked her why she was there, and without hesitation, she said, "As Africans, we must uplift all the people of Africa." 
And find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic, single solutions, and more about a multiplicity of things. 
Was I worth that? 
She is graceful, she is mysterious and she is transcendent, and those are the central qualities of glamour. 
Your actions? 
The string theory; the idea that all of reality emanates from the vibrations of these teeny -- I call it "The Big Twang." 
I'm old enough that I was actually born before we saw this image. 
You guessed it. 
This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. 
I put aside all my freelance work after hours and started just focusing particularly on this problem. 
Another strategy for preventing nanoparticles from getting stuck in the liver is to use the body's own nanoparticles. 
What was this place called Minto? 
Inside, I feel good, I feel charming, seductive, sexy. 
Well, I don't know what you're thinking, but I'm talking about the beards. (Laughter) And no matter how long I've spent on the ocean, I haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard, and I hope that it remains that way. 
And that became the baseline of what I was doing. 
How did we all get so lucky? 
Avarice is the old woman clutching the strongbox and a fisherman's hook to pull in her fortune. 
There are only three bodies to think about in our solar system, with regard to liquid water on the surface of a planet, and in order of distance from the sun, it's: Venus, Earth and Mars. 
We are seeing the advent of mobile money. 
I recognized that feeling. 
Then my teacher said, "Really? Well, Young-ha, you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling." 
So I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers like these in the south China factory city called Dongguan. 
They can be spinning hundreds of times a second. 
And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk. 
Let's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be. 
And in fact, it was the stories that I've documented that inspired me to get through the last year, to survive, to get back up on my new legs and to be able to come and tell their stories, but also my own story. 
She was a victim of the foster care system. 
Technology has this extraordinary capacity to both instantiate and continue all of our most extraordinary, often hidden desires and biases and encoding them into the world, but it also writes them down so that we can see them, so that we can't pretend they don't exist anymore. 
Orwell was indeed opposed to all forms of tyranny, spending much of his life fighting against anti-democratic forces of both the left-wing and the right. 
Your heart is beating using the solar energy that some plant processed for you, and the stuff your body is made out of is made out of CO2 that some plant processed for you. 
I had a lot of dreams as a young girl. 
Our special is tracking cookie. 
But despite the fact that the Federalists, once in power, actually enacted laws that criminalized criticism of the government -- that happened in the United States -- nevertheless, the Republicans fought back, and Madison began to emphasize the freedom of speech, which he had built into the Bill of Rights, and the capacity of civil society to organize. 
It's important for us to grow organically. 
The second wave was the mutated, super-killer wave. 
They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention. 
And so what you realize is that Darwin, in a sense, had the idea, he had the concept, but was unable to fully think it yet. 
It was like it was yesterday. 
They'd been finding photos and photo albums and cameras and SD cards. 
We know that black women express their individuality and experience feelings of empowerment by experimenting with different hairstyles regularly. 
And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps. 
(Banjo tuning) (Music: "John Brown's Dream") (Banjo) (Banjo continues) (Singing) John Brown's dream, John Brown's dream the devil was dead. 
When every decision you made was so conscious and deliberate? 
I went from supervisor to supervisor, begging to submit evidence of Anna's son's special needs, but no one would even talk to me about the case. 
Dumpster. 
We're talking about real actors and real performance, performing onstage. 
He was adored and treated as the golden boy. 
Gyo means fish and taku means impression. 
And I thought, thank God, because shame is this horrible topic, no one wants to talk about it. 
When asked in a TV interview, "How could she look so good?" 
We want to say the same thing 10, 20, 30 years from now: look what we've done over the last 30 years. 
It also represents an alternative to waiting around for big investors to bring chain stores, or big-box stores to our communities, because honestly, those types of developments, they steal resources from our communities. 
And you know from personal experience that when you go to the movies, you walk into a movie theater, and if it's empty, you're delighted, because nothing's going to be between you and the movie. 
That I carry within me. 
Well, emerging science suggests that growing up in poverty is associated with a host of different experiences and that these experiences in turn may work together to help shape brain development and ultimately help kids learn. 
Well, he was the former oil minister of Nigeria under President Abacha, and it just so happens he's a convicted money launderer too. 
And so, as we've thought about this, you know, it's become clear to us what the next stage of TED's evolution has to be. 
And sugar isn't just in candies and desserts, it's also added to tomato sauce, yogurt, dried fruit, flavored waters, or granola bars. 
This first project is called the AlloBrain. 
My children are Americans. 
But this particular reality was not inevitable. 
So I'm saying something far more radical than those physicists. 
They might, some place out there. 
JB: Yes. 
But actually, how do American atheists stack up numerically? 
That's my job. I'm paid to do it. Pitifully poor, but I am paid to do it. 
And to do that, we tried to connect up the five towers into a single system. 
As the water cools, ions precipitate out as mineral crystals, including quartz crystals from silicon and oxygen, feldspar from potassium, aluminum, silicon, and oxygen, galena from lead and sulfur. 
The experiment asks us to consider a world in which scientists have developed a machine that would simulate real life while guaranteeing experiences of only pleasure and never pain. 
If you're a low-income kid, almost half of you face multiple instances of childhood trauma. 
It's a sentiment that's pretty common among female engineers that I work with and that I know. 
Psychologists studied behavior objectively, neuroscientists studied the brain objectively, and nobody even mentioned consciousness. 
In Omagh, bomb went off, Real IRA, middle of a peace process. 
What do you mean, "data"? What's the difference -- documents, data? 
It sounds strange, but just follow me for a while. 
But within that infrastructure, we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution. 
No pressure. 
I can't change the condition of the road, but I can make the cycle run faster. 
Notice that even though the number of notes in each bar has changed, the total number of beats in each bar hasn't. 
(Laughter) There the alternative just boggles the imagination. 
And what they built was eBox. 
One is quasi-active, like the flu example I gave, where we get some people to nominate their friends and then passively monitor their friends -- do they have the flu, or not? -- and then get warning. 
And here, the idea is not that my weight gain is causing your weight gain, nor that I preferentially form a tie with you because you and I share the same body size, but rather that we share a common exposure to something, like a health club that makes us both lose weight at the same time. 
In the astronaut business -- the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle; it's the most complicated flying machine ever built. 
So it would be totally renewable. 
Now, why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb? 
It was like designing one of the first churches for Christianity or one of the first mosques for Islam. 
The pointillist movement is that kind of paintings where everything is broken down into dots and pixels. 
This is the earlier design of that house.

Because we are all patients, we are all people. 
I wish I did. 
JM: Our careers had taken off! 
In fact the words "wrong number" were more popular than the word "Hello." 
So I was really excited, because not only do we make something cool, but we might actually have the opportunity to do something real and make it useful. 
The subject is 35. 
It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate and join together into groups, but in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups. 
No one hears you in a stall, you're just texting quietly. 
Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel. 
The brain processes this in parallel, the figments of information asking a whole bunch of questions to create a unified mental model. 
So basically, we've used those two factors. 
I've worked in print. I've worked in documentary. 
That's his hair. You get a lot of figure-ground problems. 
HA: We are doing C-sections and different operations because people need some help. 
Also, the news capitalizes on our morbid interest in what can go wrong, captured in the programming policy, "If it bleeds, it leads." 
If you've seen the film "Control Room" that was sent out, you'd understand a little bit why. 
This isn't about Reddit itself, it's actually about humpback whales. 
I'm reminded of how, just last year -- you might remember it -- the first members of the al Qaeda-affiliated Ansar Dine were indicted for war crimes and sent to the Hague. 
Twan Verdonck is really young, I think he's 27, and working together with some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial stimulation for children that have psychological impairments.

The doctors and nurses were phenomenal. 
Within a week of her deployment, all her fellow agents were arrested, and Noor was called home. 
And another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down. 
And when I do that I actually specialize the brain to be a master processor for that meaningless sound. 
And if you make a three-dimensional structure, like a buckyball, they have all sorts of incredible properties. 
But we can also store energy using superconductors, because we have no dissipation. 
You're on Coke." (Laughter) "You moved to New York with an MBA, one clean suit, and an extremely firm handshake. 
That's next year's Yves Klein, you know, eyeglasses shape. 
If I had to start the service again, I would not emphasize the follower count as much. 
And this is how you look at Africa. 
And you'll see, there's some damage to the surface of the coral. 
But if you look really closely at this diagram, you'll see something that doesn't make a lot of sense. 
Bridget was born in Cameroon, the oldest of four children. 
And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on. 
And again, when you start seeing that kind of embrace, and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle with a very, very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle with a much higher footprint, it starts to become very sobering. 
My idea is: no! No! 
And if we do, maybe, just maybe, we can get rid of these dumb little stickers. 
So, for instance, in all of Asia recently, it was impossible to get YouTube for a little while because Pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring YouTube in its internal network. 
Now, my doppelgänger was Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter character -- (Laughter) a sci-fi hero who was once a Confederate soldier.

Stories matter. 
They work more paid hours, on average, than their wives, and they genuinely want to be good, involved dads. 
We've labeled the white blood cells so you can see them flowing through, and when they detect that infection, they begin to stick. 
This really happened. 
That was the magic number. 
People are living longer and societies are getting grayer. 
And this is because, in the digital age of conflict, there exists a feedback loop where new technologies, platforms like the ones I mentioned, and more disruptive ones, can be adapted, learned, and deployed by individuals and organizations faster than governments can react. 
(Laughter) (Applause) I'm not a citizen of this country, so I hope it won't be thought unbecoming if I suggest that something needs to be done. 
For a long time, I didn't believe that I could have a big adventure. 
And if a child inherits a copy of the mutation from only one parent, there will be just enough abnormal hemoglobin to make life difficult for the malaria parasite, while most of their red blood cells retain their normal shape and function. 
But we have to be careful because malaria -- the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves. 
Carole Lartigue led the effort to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another. 
And there's the building. Everything was painted -- typography over the whole damn thing, including the air conditioning ducts. 
To address questions like that, scientists are now scanning other species of animals, and they're also scanning human infants. 
(Laughter) You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you. 
And I became obsessed with this idea of blurring the perimeter of the body, so you couldn't see where the skin ended and the near environment started. 
I'm talking to you about modern-day slavery. 
The first thing the diving reflex does is make your heart rate drop. 
The only place you find rights are in the stories that we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries. 
LD: At the opposite end of the spectrum is Argentina. 
Think about this: this attack is generic. 
It's as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other instead of talking with each other. 
So who said this? This is Alan Turing in 1951. 
Here's an analogy. 
The world is facing so many different conservation crises. 
Because of the stigma surrounding the treatment, she worried that doing so might negatively impact her personal and professional life, but she knew ECT could make a difference for patients when all else failed. 
If we go beyond our solar system, we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light. 
So allow me to express that if I make you laugh, it's usually on purpose. 
Americans call it PTSD or traumatic neurosis. 
I'd call that radical. 
I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough. 
Today, those lands are the 763,000-acre Patagonian National Park, and it looks like this. 
Now, we all know that wolves kill various species of animals, but perhaps we're slightly less aware that they give life to many others. 
But any remaining panic subsided as I walked into the courtroom and looked around at a sea of friendly faces: our individual women clients who had shared their deeply personal stories, the geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers to dedicate themselves to this fight and representatives from a diverse array of medical, patient advocacy, environmental and religious organizations, who had submitted friend of the court briefs in the case. 
(Laughter) Been there. 
This is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris -- and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year. 
Because, of course, the best jobs go to people out of the Western Universities, that I put on earlier. 
So what started out as an idea, is now being implemented to churn out millions of sequences that we can use to investigate the long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease, right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens. 
So, we ingested the entire first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries, but we did this separately for two groups of people: people that are famous and people that are not famous. 
And authenticity is therefore becoming the new consumer sensibility -- the buying criteria by which consumers are choosing who are they going to buy from, and what they're going to buy. 
My Tea Party lunch mate and I came up with these: "Don't persuade, defend or interrupt; be curious, be conversational, be real; and listen." 
Hopefully, she will stop pressuring me to get married now. 
That's for sure. 
And then there was a second level to this object, which is that it -- I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in, which is the diameter of the Moon and the diameter of the Earth in proportion to each other. 
You may think they're obsolete now that our science and technology are so powerful. 
I basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers. 
Token support will not cut it. 
(Laughter) And [it] shows the Earth in a time flag: on the right, in trilobites and dinosaurs and so on; and over the triangle, we now get to civilization and TV and traffic jams and so on. 
But what is surprising and somewhat dismaying, is how little impact this insight has had, in terms of how we think about human suffering and war. 
(Laughter) Six and a half days, that certainly is a fatal dose. 
(Laughter) We live in an age when knowledge of emotions is an extremely important commodity, where emotions are used to explain many things, exploited by our politicians, manipulated by algorithms. 
Let's meet some of the world's newest satellite engineers. 
So, I do not recommend this. 
It wasn't easy, but we felt at heart, it was a positive way to make change, and I'm in awe at the teachers that took that leap with me. 
Now, we tend to believe that today, with all of the technology, the smartphones and the Internet, we are able to see and understand most of what's happening in the world, and people are able to tell their story — but it's only partly true. 
But I couldn't do anything else. 
There is a revolution. 
So where it's happening, we can see, but what is happening will remain invisible only. 
That's what we need to do. 
When I found out about her story, I wrote about it, and within 24 hours, it created such an uproar that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges. 
We develop more emotional maturity if we play more. 
Children bring stones for the foundation, women bring water for the brick manufacturing, and everybody works together to pound the clay floors. 
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator. 
But first we ought to be capturing bigger, cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks. 
We're trying to introduce you to what I believe is the most wonderful part, you being able to talk in your natural voice to Milo. 
Go to bed. 
Why would I buy insurance now?" 
This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company, right when it launched, and it's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical. 
They're just choosing randomly. 
But my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible. 
I'm like, "How?" 
When Emperor Qin Shi Huang unified the states in 221 BCE, the Tibetan Plateau and Pacific Ocean became natural barriers, but the mountains in the north remained vulnerable to Mongol, Turkish, and Xiongnu invasions. 
We see this in the public sector as well. 
So the group of appliances that we've all gotten used to, we all want and we all need, we all see as part of our everyday lives that give us health and security, those appliances have come down in cost. 
We'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame." 
They belong somewhere. Maybe in a museum; not here. 
Poor posture inflicts extra wear and tear on your joints and ligaments, increases the likelihood of accidents, and makes some organs, like your lungs, less efficient. 
And first, just knowing what they're going through. 
But it's up to us to decide which legacy we want to attach our flag to. 
So if you want to communicate something visually, have between five and 13 nodes in your diagram. 
In fact, more than 58 countries are still contaminated with any sort of explosive device. 
The map they made is complicated. 
He told me that he was abused above ground and was once in Riker's Island, and at last he found peace and quiet in that space. 
It conquers all. 
The only way we could be sure of this would be through a PET scan, because at this point, you are blissfully unaware. 
Our existence has been co-opted, silenced and erased. 
Again, I fear it will cost money. 
If you look at the statistics -- these are worldwide statistics -- in every single age category, women actually outnumber men in their use of social networking technologies. 
So if we refuse to talk to these new groups that are going to be dominating the news in years to come, we will further radicalization, I believe. 
Investing in professional development is not a cost. 
In the 1850s, Brigham Young dispatched families to St. George to grow cotton because of the hot, arid climate. 
And you know, when I knew him when I was in the office, he would come in from a trip, and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely, and he would pack up and go. 
I mean look, you can see the necktie, but you can't even imagine seeing the size of a little, small atom. 
The Canadian government allows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees. 
In addition to making this personal -- so we're going to talk about your relationship with your heart and all women's relationship with their heart -- we're going to wax into the politics. 
No sophistication, no class, no dignity, no history. 
But I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today is far worse and far more violent. 
And one of our real worries with Colony Collapse Disorder is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead-out colonies. 
I discovered that true communication is about more than merely physically conveying a message. 
I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two, and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices. 
Bissel Gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions, moving kids into an economy they never imagined. 
Finally, very recently, we were able to track down a dig site where a local fossil hunter found several bones of Spinosaurus. 
Working memory allows us to investigate our current experience as we move forward. 
In our Western cultures, it means eradicating or reversing a disease, but in different cultures, for example, a culture from Asia, from the Mediterranean, from Latin countries, from Africa, it can mean many more things. 
It wasn't until the final chapter of this story that I realized just how well midwifery had trained me. 
But first I want to discuss the obvious question: Why the heck should we do this? 
Most of you. The average age of a gamer is 33 years old, not eight years old, and in fact, if we look at the projected demographics of video game play, the video game players of tomorrow are older adults. (Laughter) So video [gaming] is pervasive throughout our society. 
So instead, we can do compression-only CPR. 
If it's gone, it's gone, and if you're really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom. 
(Laughter) But we painted those walls that summer. 
Do it over lunch. 
So that's why we never find them in our throats. 
Are we going to bring concrete and cement from Earth to the Moon? 
So, how do you go about studying the brain? 
She's my friend, Dr. Shirin Ebadi, the first Muslim woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. 
And after some time, we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal, which actually now burns not only -- actually, it burns longer, cleaner than wood charcoal. 
We see that we have waiting lists in the nursing homes. 
But instead, we stick a camera in the deep ocean, and we see a fish, and it doesn't capture our imagination as a society. 
(Laughter) And that's not exactly what I said, but -- (Laughter) the point is my role in the community -- Within the free software world, there's been a long-standing tradition of the "benevolent dictator" model. 
The real powerful person is wearing a hoodie with a T-shirt and jeans. 
(Laughter) Like, at all. 
So local food production is out. 
I started hearing from parents who said their children were learning to read and write by playing on the server. 
And he wasn't there, so I walked all afternoon back. 
Above all, though, wizards object to the prophets' emphasis on wide-scale social engineering, which they see as deeply anti-democratic. 
It's really hard to cram a full symphony into a small theater, and it's really hard to do that for every theater in the world. 
He changed a lot last night, I believe. 
And it's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels is going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy getting that energy to the wheels. 
Maybe in the past, but not now." 
The proscenium can fly. 
Your overnight success story is always a result of everything you've done in your life through that moment. 
Can you imagine? 
And I thought I would do just one thing on the $100 laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here. 
You could call it TEDistan. 
And so I want to tell you about the interaction between computer-based adaptive technology and the many volunteers who helped me over the years to become the person I am today. 
They're really approaching -- in many cases, surpassing -- the ability of the human mind. 
It won't be so clear-cut; it won't be Microsoft versus Linux -- there'll be all sorts of things in between. 
RM: Namely, the founding of Fort Dearborn on the future site of Chicago, the Great Chicago Fire, the World Columbian Exposition, which everyone remembers because of the White City, and the Century of Progress Exposition, which no one remembers at all. 
You start in the present, with relationships you're certain about. 
This is the final product. 
In addition to this kind of high-resolution geometry, since it's all captured with cameras, we've got a great texture map to use for the face. 
To make the story short, here is the coverage of the country. 
It's good to see you guys. 
We are scratching the surface in our ability as humans to communicate and invent together, and while the sciences teach us how to build things, it's the humanities that teach us what to build and why to build them. 
I'm focusing on this not because genes are the only cause of autism, but it's a cause of autism that we can readily define and be able to better understand the biology and understand better how the brain works so that we can come up with strategies to be able to intervene. 
So that's it, really. 
All of these form of power are at play. 
I thought the word "framework" was great. 
In 2004, in Sri Lanka, after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami, I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages. 
So there is this direct line between feminine handicraft, Euclid and general relativity. 
Sometimes they agree. 
It's pretty incredible. 
So I asked you about that picture, and you said nobody was supposed to see that picture. 
I'll lay around; she'll make a living. 
"We're snobby and we're elitist." 
Trace amounts of the minerals iron, copper, zinc, and sodium are also fundamental to brain health and early cognitive development. 
So, in a frenzy, I corrected everybody's marks, not imaginatively. 
This program takes a shape and spits out 250 DNA sequences. 
You need to get vaccinated. 
[Video] RP: Are those pretzels a trick? 
A: Tell me about this world. 
And I remembered back to about 10 years ago when I read a book by Susan Faludi called "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man," in which she described how hard the recession had hit men, and I started to think about whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession. 
So if you search for really popular kids' cartoons like "Peppa Pig" or "Paw Patrol," you'll find there's millions and millions of these online as well. 
This is, like, half the total spent on education in the US. 
(Laughter) One of my senior colleagues told me, when I was a youngster in this profession, rather proudly, that statisticians were people who liked figures but didn't have the personality skills to become accountants. 
And he orders a pint, and they sit in silence for a while. 
This is a painting from Magritte, in the museum in Holland that I love so much. 
You may be thinking, you didn't create these 3D models with only tourist photographs, and that's true. 
But I'd want one who would play offense, too. 
We're trying to be part of this global village, but at the same time we're revising ourselves through our cultural institutions and cultural development. 
It's interesting. 
So one thing that I do agree with, and I think most experts would, is that the brain does have these dynamics. 
(Laughter) We hacked a quick and dirty algorithm that would find the perfect Tinder matches, like people living as close as possible having answered the questions as differently as possible. 
As it turned out, my experience wasn't an isolated case. 
As I give this talk, there are more than 700 Confederate monuments standing nationwide. 
Here's an image of your classic genome sequencer. 
Roy warns that the tragic consequences of their relationship “would lurk forever in ordinary things,” like “coat hangers,” “the tar on roads,” and “the absence of words.” Roy’s writing makes constant use of these ordinary things, bringing lush detail to even the most tragic moments. 
I wanted to make it open to the widest possible range of people, not just the 49 percent who can get the numbers. 
The term organic describes that the material used for light absorption and charge transport are mainly based on the element carbon, and not on metals. 
But who's doing even better? 
So in 2016, I started tracing some of these memes back to their source, back to the people who were making them or who were making them go viral. 
MW: In the years that we have been campaigning, we have learned a lot. 
"Surviving the Slammer: Do's and Don'ts." 
Will you accept it?" 
I look at this person -- by the way, in desire people rarely talk about it, when we are blended into one, five centimeters from each other. 
As a journalist, I really care about how we relate to each other through language, and the way we tell that story, with all the gory, violent detail, the salacious aspects -- I call that "look at her scars" journalism. 
(Laughter) And now it's in there, somewhere. 
So to do the unnecessary, to create intimacy, to be ugly, to remain incomplete -- these are not only the qualities of beautiful organizations, these are inherently human characteristics. 
But I decided then to just give it a try. 
And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music -- I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover with the MIT Media Lab -- it relates a lot to music. 
A host of private companies have plans to deploy tens of thousands of satellites into Earth orbit, where they will not only outnumber, literally outnumber the visible stars in the sky, while also beaming invisible light back to Earth. 
Here, the roofs are not designed to bear additionally heavy loads. 
They decide what is too offensive or too provocative for you to see. 
So we can go, jump, and take a look at all the TED Prize winners. 
National newspapers lambasted the police, and Congressional hearings investigated their actions during the parade. 
Here are the four things I came up with.

There wouldn’t be a third time, as the messenger Hermes dragged Sisyphus back to Hades. 
They're little pieces of string that wrap their way through the city center or through the city. 
Is this type of experience what someone who buys the product will get? 
And it's looking around, and when it finds something, and recognizes it being foreign, it will actually engulf it and eat it. 
Here I was trying to help, and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid -- yet another box. 
Rather, big ideas can be orchestrated, if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don't ordinarily talk about. 
It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang, but gives us no insight into what would have powered the Bang itself. 
And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion -- in fact, the Koran says that "God decreed upon himself compassion," or, "reigned himself in by compassion" -- therefore, our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion, activators of compassion, actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion. 
On the contrary, imagine actually that you start from a document, a Venetian manuscript, and you show, actually, what you can construct out of it, how it is decoded, how the context of that document can be recreated. 
But this, I show you, when kids from the poorest congressional district in America can build a 30-foot by 15-foot wall, design it, plant it and install it in the heart of New York City, that's a true "sí se puede" moment. 
As fast as we can reset our computers, the brain activity shifts to start representing this new tool, as if this too was a part of that primate's body. 
Guns are not a part of our lives. 
At times, they are complimented by negotiated settlements, or at least cease-fire agreements, and peacekeepers are deployed. 
I watched everything that I'd built crumbling, and it looked like all this stuff was going to die and 15 years work would have come for nothing. 
Now you've heard of hydrothermal vents, but the other discovery is that deep below the sea floor, there is vast reservoir of microbial activity, which we have only just discovered and we have almost no way to study. 
I don't even know why they make me slow down, but something pulls me like a magnet and then I ignore all the others, and I just go to that painting. 
And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes. 
Machine learning isn't perfect, and it still makes plenty of mistakes. 
And it's terribly endangered. 
That's a lot of light. 
The minute he stops, we have neither. 
In a traditional academic model, we group students together, usually by age, and around middle school, by age and perceived ability, and we shepherd them all together at the same pace. 
SW: Yeah, that's right. 
And so we need to move past our feelings. 
What about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there? 
I'd like for us to imagine for a second. 
I have never built an atomic pile. 
(Laughter) You asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer. 
But because of what Snow did, because of this map, because of the whole series of reforms that happened in the wake of this map, we now take for granted that cities have 10 million people, cities like this one are in fact sustainable things. 
And I was one of them. 
Perhaps adopting a similar approach might allow us users to reclaim our own attention, and give us back one of the things that feels so rare in modern life: rest. 
But we don't just have pies in the boxes. 
Is such a game even legal? 
She bypasses the neuroscientific and structural analyses that science has to offer about how her adverse childhood experiences inform why she's participating in violence and goes straight to describing herself as a "problem child," largely because that's the language that educators were using as they routinely suspended her. 
I mean, really, you know? 
So if you beat your wife, you're going to be there. 
But ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between, because it's a mechanical force. 
The majority of the 60,000 children who have participated in UPSTART to date have been from Utah. 
I suppose you could eventually decode it, but it's really not very well written; it really wouldn't be worthwhile. 
We can see the big picture. 
So this is an image of a middle-aged ex-professional football player, and the thing that I want to point out is if you look at the corpus callosum, and I'll page back here so you can see the size of a normal corpus callosum and the size of the person here who has chronic traumatic encephalopathy, it is greatly atrophied. 
And this really is the crucial insight. 
This was a bet-your-company moment, and Jini seized it. 
It's just not true. (Laughter) And I'm going to talk about three reasons why it's wrong. 
GS: Exactly. It was perfect. 
It creates a two-tiered system: legal and illegal work. 
The airplane patent holders were not left a choice whether they'd license their patents or not. 
It's very exciting to think where we get to go with this. 
So now that Egyptians have ended Mubarak's 30-year rule, they potentially could be an example for the region. 
Majora mentioned this. 
Now that you tackled low-stakes and no-stakes decisions, you've created the space and time you'll need to handle high-stakes decisions. 
The tricks of magic have one special element. 
We were talking about the rapture? It's coming. 
When they put these guys in an fMRI machine, scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers and people's faces and pictures of snowflakes, they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain than everyone else. 
And it was. 
Some post the formula for calculating pay, and others post the pay levels and affix everybody to that level. 
I can love jogging. 
Perhaps we feel that many of our relationships have not had closure. 
But if robots can be engaging, if we like to cooperate with robots, if robots are persuasive, maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program, maybe they can help you manage your weight. 
But I'm here to tell you that these places exist, they still exist. 
Even policy designed to help prevent recessions can contribute. 
Until the 1940s, market research was often quantitative using things like sales figures and customer polls to track consumption. 
We have an inverter in there, so you get 117 volts AC. 
Next, I had to design a wearable wireless circuit, but wireless signal transmission consumes lots of power and requires heavy, bulky batteries. 
That requires imagination. 
And we buckled down to see if we could turn this into a business.

And in particular, corn-soybean rotation. 
(Clapping) (Music) (Trombone solo) (Trumpet solo) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause and cheers) Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The Soul Rebels. Thank you! 
And in a typical dentistry visit, you may have about 15 to 30 milligrams removed. 
Have excellent evidence and strong allies. 
On the unfortunate days when I have to wake up at 4am, I'm a zombie. 
When he first proposed universal grammar, the idea that there was a genetically determined aspect of language acquisition had a profound, revolutionary impact. 
And on the other side of the political spectrum, George H.W. Bush, number 41, the father, he has agreed to participate, and Nick Kroll, the comedian, and Dr. Oz, and many more to come. 
What do I mean by that? 
Australia said, we will take you in. 
And that is a newer, interdisciplinary field, and there I found reports that linked the striatum not just to social anomalies in mice, but also in people. 
Now, in the Bahamas, we also have resident bottlenose that interact socially with the spotted dolphins. 
And she said, "Yes, because he has a beautiful daughter and two beautiful grandchildren, and he doesn't know that, and I do. 
Even with market, which is about chance, randomness, we think we can predict rationally where it's going. 
These questions were a few of the first ones in the pilot phase of the Ignorance Project in Gapminder Foundation that we run, and it was started, this project, last year by my boss, and also my son, Ola Rosling. (Laughter) He's cofounder and director, and he wanted, Ola told me we have to be more systematic when we fight devastating ignorance. 
And I was guilty of all of those things, so the shame had to be mine. 
So first, if you are the type, like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone, remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals so it's clearly about the movement, not you. 
Maybe this is something unique about diarrhea. 
(Laughter) Now, "All Shook Up" is a great love song. 
BF: This guy, this guy invented air. 
We built a Hyperloop test track adjacent to SpaceX, just for a student competition, to encourage innovative ideas in transport. 
So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future, we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology, a science of what makes life worth living. 
Cities are the crucible of civilization. 
We used a lot of machine learning to improve things incrementally, but I think for me, this example's really exciting, because it's one program that can do a lot of different things. 
This is the direction of south, this way, and if you go 8,000 kilometers out of the back of this room, you will come to as far south as you can go anywhere on Earth, the Pole itself. 
So we've got about 100,000 pieces up there. 
Chemical fertilizers by definition don't have carbon in them. 
However, recent theories in physics, including one called string theory, are now telling us there could be countless other universes built on different types of particles, with different properties, obeying different laws. 
(Applause) KKM: Our relationship has always been about setting each other free. 
I always felt most creative when I worked from home. 
This is the Livingston Public Library that was completed in 2004 in my hometown, and, you know, it's got a dome and it's got this round thing and columns, red brick, and you can kind of guess what Livingston is trying to say with this building: children, property values and history. 
What excites you about the work that you do? 
That's three times higher than the United States. 
The mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seam on a baseball. 
It's going to change what money is. 
That means that you can't give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it, say, to see if it has any mutations, without permission of the patent holder. 
I said, "Well, you know, it's just a movie! Come on." 
You know that all over the world, people fight for their freedom, fight for their rights. 
So I wanted to follow those. 
Clock has one arm longer than the other. 
Upon her return to Warsaw, though, she found that securing an academic position as a woman remained a challenge. 
Pretty much no matter what I do, my job always starts with sitting down with a whole bunch of binary information, and I'm always looking for one key piece to do something specific. 
(Applause) Now, a little more difficult thing. 
Let n equal zero. 
This discrimination affects our health, our well-being and our income, and the effects add up over time. 
Again, don't answer out loud. 
But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss. 
Well, it basically boils down to this: the brain is made up of neurons which are these little cells that send electrical signals to each other. 
And so I think what we're going to see is two trends take place with this. 
And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights. 
But it doesn't have a happy ending. 
And sadly, I think there are. 
And so I did some experiments. 
Some of these fishes, which had arm bones in their fins, sprouted fingers, seven or eight per flipper. 
So we did what you do in science when you're not sure, and we ran it again. 
(Music) All right, so it's a delicate dance. 
Whenever it rains, magically, mushrooms appear overnight. 
Back inside, I asked my classmates if they were having the same experience of words jumping around our cases as I was. 
Secondly -- and you're going to hear more from me about this -- we have to become an outward-looking, space-faring nation. 
Why can I not remove this confine and take that to my everyday objects, everyday life so that I don't need to learn the new language for interacting with those pixels? 
On the other side of the country, I went to class and wrote a poem in the margins of my notebook. 
So what happened is, the data that you just saw was actually on a PDF. 
Because when we looked at the video when he got back, we saw 20 minutes of this. 
I'm only going to tell you about one of them today. 
When I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old, we were playing on top of a bunk bed. 
And I wrote a book about her and I illustrated it and the things Ruby taught me go like this. 
What we've targeted for ourselves -- and we're making great progress toward this goal -- is to have a propulsion system based on hydrogen and fuel cells, designed and validated, that can go head-to-head with the internal combustion engine. 
It was the sound of our grieving, the feel of their arms around me, the steady walls that held us together. 
Perhaps most exciting to me is an idea that Bill Gates, Howard Buffett and others have supported boldly, which is to ask the question: What if, instead of looking at the hungry as victims -- and most of them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food or sell food to even support their own families -- what if we view them as the solution, as the value chain to fight hunger? 
By the second millennium BCE, chickens had spread from the Indus Valley to China and the Middle East to occupy royal menageries and to be used in religious rituals. 
So we've got these challenges, and what Richard Thaler and I were always fascinated by -- take behavioral finance, make it behavioral finance on steroids or behavioral finance 2.0 or behavioral finance in action -- flip the challenges into solutions. 
RSW: No. What did he say? 
We landed with 40 kilos. 
And computation, storage and communications capacity are in the hands of practically every connected person -- and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information, knowledge and culture, in the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet. 
And they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux. 
It represents a colossal waste of food, but what I discovered whilst I was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg. 
But I would say this: first, some very smart people are even now debating how to regulate gene drives. 
It's still speculative. 
This is something no self-respecting photographer would ever do -- you put some cheesy illustration on your shot, right? -- and yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points. 
So these animals are there, grazing away, and they're doing a couple of things. 
Now, this is not only about numbers; this is not only about the fact that we're seven billion people committed to nine billion people, it's an equity issue as well. 
The reason it's here is because, on the right-hand side, you see two little rivers kind of coming down through the sand, feeding this basin with water. 
We created the first parking-protected bike lane in the United States. 
And even for me, who's lived in India all her life, walking into one of these schools is fairly heartbreaking. 
And the way it's done, as you can see here, is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds. 
Today, chocolate has established itself in the rituals of our modern culture. 
As classmates, they all follow the same schedule. 
And there's others that are all about the toaster, and the engineers love to draw the mechanics of this. 
So about a year and a half ago, we started working on a project called WikiHouse, and WikiHouse is an open-source construction system. 
OK, simply put, yes, nudging up telomerase does decrease the risks of some diseases, but it also increases the risks of certain and rather nasty cancers. 
(Laughter) Maybe it's called genius. 
Unfortunately, all his Spinosaurus bones were destroyed in World War II. 
In fact, they're already suggesting amazing places for us to help discover, including Atlantis. 
"If it's that easy to create living organisms, why not create a few yourself?" 
This project is hereby terminated. 
And I have to admit, I still have piles of mail that haven't been sorted, and piles of emails that I haven't gone through. 
We narrowed it down to one fragment; we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene. 
Gapminder asked the public in Sweden. 
But if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff, parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a Christmas tree. 
Humanism is a way of thinking and living that emphasizes the agency of human beings. 
That is almost as heavy as three baby elephants. 
Well, I came up with this kind of linear expression thing with these cams and feedback. And that worked pretty well. 
We've seen the first form of solar energy that's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind here in the Great Plains, and so that hegemony is leaving. 
Worldwide, there are more than 2,000 firefly species, and these have evolved remarkably diverse courtship signals, that is, different ways to find and attract mates. 
This divide between what's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don't have yet a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful. 
Now, which one is going to win in a playoff? 
The number of internet users are going up like this. 
(Laughter) But there is a silver lining. 
In 1999, two and a half years into that job, something happened. 
Girl: Women! One word and they get upset. 
So you have these two different passions, for making everything free and for the almost supernatural power of the tech entrepreneur. 
And they vocalize in a chorus that's absolutely in sync with one another. 
There's a big display in the mirror, and you can turn around -- but there's a three second delay. 
He said that in 30 years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that. 
We're not going to meet targets, providing people with sanitation at this rate. 
And if that's not enough, teens who skip out on sleep are at increased risk for a host of physical health problems that plague our country, including obesity, heart disease and diabetes. 
They'll never meet that stranger; the stranger will never meet them. 
For all the women, all the mothers that give life, you can give back, you can change. 
So this is our icon to non-violence in our world -- one of our living icons. 
By the very act of trying to reason us into your position, you're conceding reason's potency. 
And so let me show you now the footage of the bridge. 
That if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this, it's amazing how we can affect the planet. 
Tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes because they get much more efficient pollination when it's done naturally and they get better quality tomatoes. 
We also refine naturally occurring radioactive ores to fuel nuclear power plants. 
So the question is: How does something that is not touching anything know where it is? 
Because -- I know that sounds a little odd -- but the thing is, I ran a poll on Twitter of what people understand the word "probably" to mean, and this was the spread of answers. 
They go to counselors and they say, "What do I need to do to get into the right college?" 
Now, it's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how I managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full-time employment. 
They cached all the oil; they got all the money; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket. 
The future "you" is about your duties to strangers. 
And there might be quite a few people here who would be very glad to see the last king cobra bite the dust. 
(Ethereal music) (Music ends) So this is the sound of my alarm clock, actually, in the morning. 
Because without that, you can't have this kind of place, food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape, and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole. 
And we think people like this probably don't want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama. 
If we work together to raise awareness, we can make sure the world knows that we need to put an end to the unnecessary institutionalization of vulnerable children. 
All of a sudden, this isn't theory anymore. 
I get all the good stuff and none of the bad. 
And there is no way to be in this universe without mass. 
And if you turn and head to this direction, follow my finger, let's have a quick look at the ACL and the PCL. 
If one looks carefully, on the Congo River is one of those bright lights. And that's the very Congo river generating light -- the old heart of darkness now generating light with hydro-electric power. 
And I said to Professor Kurokawa, "Wow, the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down." 
I stopped him there. I said, "I can explain that sighting." 
It's a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you, and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that. 
(Applause) MB: I love that -- yes. 
We created the RIA, in Spanish, or in English, Learning and Innovation Network, which is a network of community centers that bring education through the use of technology. 
Well, there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet. 
In fact, they're successful precisely because they don't share. 
And if we can solve the problems for EPA, we could apply those solutions to other eastside communities. 
Women have two copies of that big X chromosome; men have the X and, of course, that small copy of the Y. 
Are you soliciting me, young man? 
I think 2010 can be a really interesting year because it is the end of the 30-year cycle, and it's the birthday of the global food system. 
Unfortunately, it isn't that simple. 
While we should consider things like regulating political speech, labeling the fact that it's political speech, making sure foreign actors can't fund political speech, it also has its own dangers. 
At the time, I'd barely heard about Calais, but it took about two or three seconds to figure out Calais is basically known for two things. 
AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you, and HIV is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day. 
Tajfel was born in Poland in 1919. 
She acknowledges me. She waves, and she smiles. 
He had a clear shot at the German soldiers who came to occupy a free country, his country, our country. 
Where is that place for you where people who are affected by a unique problem can meet a unique solution? 
Or two: You give 100,000 dollars to one savvy entrepreneur and help her set up a factory that yields 40 percent additional income to all 500 banana farmers and creates 50 additional jobs. 
My school had athletics, band, choir, debate and other clubs, but there were no STEM programs or research mentors. 
(Whistling) (Laughter) ♫ My preacher said, ♫ ♫ Don't you worry ♫ ♫ The scientists have it all wrong ♫ ♫ And so, who cares it's winter here? ♫ ♫ And I have my halter-top on ♫ ♫ I have my halter-top on ♫ ♫ Everyone's out in merry Manhattan in January. ♫ (Applause) Chris Anderson: Jill Sobule! 
This number is small. 
The numbers won't determine the outcome. 
And we do not want to wait another hundred years. 
It was like time would stop, and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done, 1,000 nights before, but everything would align. 
These fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months. 
I went into the villages to work in rural India. 
(Laughter) GH: What had I gotten myself into? 
So there you go. My name is John Hodgman. 
In one study, scientists looked at about 17,000 children who were born in 1970. 
Features of the environment matter too: In one experiment, volunteers with a cold rod placed on the back of their hand reported feeling more pain when they were shown a red light than a blue one, even though the rod was the same temperature each time. 
Between the official story -- the food pyramid -- and the hip locavore vision, you have two versions of how to improve our eating. 
So we're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better, faster, stronger. 
Barely at first, but better all the time. 
Not the drag queen part -- I am not shaving my hair for anyone -- but the gay part. 
(Laughter) MB: Now, we've had to time this bit perfectly because of the requirement for local anesthetic. 
And they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years, until it got stolen in January of 2007. 
(Applause) Thank you, Jesus. 
Now, there are practical reasons why you may want to know the answer to such a question. 
(Laughter) And then he said, "Why would they vote for him?" 
We can reach them. There are paths that enable us to reach them. 
This is known as a molar quantity. 
IXK: Thank you. 
And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages, with cheap webcams, lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow. 
We now live in a global village where we can mimic the ties that used to happen face to face, but on a scale and in ways that have never been possible before. 
Normal people say, she's warm like the sun, she's radiant like the sun, she's nurturing like the sun. 
(Singing) "I had a dream. 
They began to think of an escape route from this prisoner's dilemma, and we developed concepts of collective action, basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table, explaining to all of them how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop bribing, and to make a long story short, we managed to eventually get Germany to sign together with the other OECD countries and a few other exporters. 
Let's hear from Tony Hayward again. 
Before he got up to get ready for his own match, he gave me this piece of advice that would change the entire direction of my life. 
Since the only column missing both these values is the center one, this must be the Brit's red-walled home. 
These possessions, their lives and their lifestyles are now displayed in vivid detail on the ubiquitous social media platforms of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat. 
This brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently, that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world, from biotechnology, that literally could destroy the world's food supply in very short order. 
In the haste to grow more, sell more, 4,000 years of agriculture in a country of rich natural resources is spoiled by the overuse of chemicals and pesticides. 
Ludwig Wittgenstein, perhaps the greatest philosopher of the 20th century, was astonished that there should be a world at all. 
And we had a mix of dumb stuff on there -- making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame because that cuts the infection rate by half -- and then interesting stuff, because you can't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery. 
(Laughter) But have you ever gone to a bar and come out with a $200 million business? 
I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race. 
AM: ... ice-skating gait. There isn't all this sort of snake way of walking. 
People spend their time in meetings, writing reports they have to do, undo and redo. 
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well. 
The cows that are waiting all around us. 
And so for those Americans who claim they are committed to racial equality who also recognize the importance of economic livelihood and who also know that wealth is inherited, and the majority of wealth is inherited, and when you think of the inheritance, you're thinking of past, and the past policies that many Americans consider to be racist, whether it's slavery or even redlining, how would we even begin to close this growing racial wealth gap without a massive program like reparations? 
So I get some software and start reading it, and scan them, and it turns out it's a puzzle. 
It's their knowledge that spells the difference between survival and death for their whole society in a time of crisis caused by rare events for which only the oldest people alive have had experience. 
I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. 
Often it's thought that that's an emotion that comes up out of pity. 
And they decided to go not only for health and education, but also starting to grow their economy. 
You know, how can it work? 
Combustion creates that sensory experience using fuel, heat, and oxygen. 
To put that in perspective, the rest of the world has not studied 100 brains since we started this. 
And I came up with these. 
The first frack job was in '47. 
Panmure House was the home of the world-renowned Scottish economist Adam Smith. 
We have to plan issues many months in advance; we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months, nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business. 
So really important progress is being made. 
You can see the baby's sleeping, but there's not too much information there. 
So we carried on sailing and we arrived at the North Pole. 
I was trying to convert language, convert sentences in English into sentences in FreeSpeech, and vice versa, and back and forth. 
I love this. 
But then they realized there was a problem with bitcoin, because every bitcoin transaction is actually recorded publicly in a public ledger. 
I got an erection in response to the phrase 'doughnut hole.'" (Laughter) Did he want to have sex with the doughnut? 
And today I'm going to share with you what really makes a difference -- that's what's crucial, how and why they set meaningful and audacious goals, the right goals for the right reasons. 
It seemed like my instincts in fifth grade were correct. 
It's no coincidence. 
And as individuals, we all do these things, all the time, everyday. 
And yet, we don't have the basic doctrines to guide us in this regard. 
There are three aspects to this general trend that I think are underappreciated; I think we would understand AI a lot better if we understood these three things. 
Vodka, New Year's Eve -- new partner for the spring. 
And so Jon had a brilliant idea: He went out to recruit the best of the best dancers off of YouTube to create this dance troupe -- The League of Extraordinary Dancers, the LXD. 
So if it has some special feature, like being really elegant or really full or really simple, like nothingness, that would require an explanation. 
But you didn't need it to describe the large, everyday objects around us. 
(Applause) GK: I know you learn a lot from winning, but what have you learned from losing? 
Other times I wouldn't be able to speak or move at all. 
There's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed, some about new aesthetics, new approaches to food. 
His name was Yared. 
So that wasn't so great for him. 
And we've all had the feeling, right? 
So at this point, based on visual patterns, I can find the code on the phone. 
Or Google is quite generous, so he can have one or two years to go. 
And it's 12 units used in the entire world, and the richest one billion, they use six of them. 
This is the tension the women calling me were feeling. 
It's very expensive. 
Sixty-six years after the Wright Brothers took off from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Neil Armstrong was 240,000 miles away. 
He said, "You can tell a lot about someone," in this case a woman, "by the company that she keeps." 
There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just -- (Applause) thinking about. 
Not the lowercase, muttered-behind-my-back kind, or the seemingly harmless chubby or cuddly. 
If you've taken time when you are outdoors to look at the feathers around you, you'll have noticed that there is this huge variety of different sizes, shapes and even colors. 
So I took her ears to the lab. 
But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. 
Some fruits get some insect damage. 
But there are two problems with that. 
But I dropped my protest to keep my job. 
It's just about, I want to create some great experiences. 
But it's critically important because perception and regulation of the internal state of the body -- well, that's what keeps us alive. 
The problem is the lack of trust, the lack of confidence, the lack of partnership between NGOs, campaign groups, civil society organizations and multinational companies. 
And then they come home and they have to give all that up and they're coming back to a society, a modern society, which is hard on people who weren't even in the military. 
There's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will, if those are your experiments. 
He doesn't look like a guy who's paying off French judges for his foie gras. 
I had thought always -- and in fact, had written this in my first book; this was a book about gardening -- that lawns were nature under culture's boot, that they were totalitarian landscapes, and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex. 
But just to provide context. 
(Audience: Who made them?) AM: It's a company in San Diego called Flex-Foot. 
It gets even more interesting, because small size does not stop them from being powerful through sheer number. 
That's why we do our work. 
Mathematical and logical arguments like the dinner party brainteaser work because even when people reach different conclusions, they’re starting from the same set of shared beliefs. 
It went from being this ridiculously niche creature suited only to this one specific environment, to being this world traveler that just happens to be in the Sahara, and could end up virtually anywhere. 
I started to write about sharing the fact that I'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse, including three rapes. 
They're hard to just get automatically. 
He had dropped out, he was a gang member, a criminal. 
The nervous system has lots of these gated channels, controlling pathways for movement, memory, and consciousness. 
And just for your information, the magnetic field of a magnetar is 1,000 trillion times the magnetic field of Earth. 
Chris Anderson: So our first speaker gave a TED Talk at TEDGlobal I think seven years ago. 
And I found that it's actually been very, very important to record even just that one second of a really bad moment. 
There will be two big summits this year: the first one, in September in New York, is the summit for the sustainable development goals. 
Another section of the family presented their clothing, as opposed to their physical presence, because they didn't want to be identified with the past that I was highlighting. 
And they just wiped out -- these pathogens just wiped out the native people, who had no immunity to them at all. 
So it appears that all three primary caregivers -- myself, my wife and our nanny -- were systematically and, I would think, subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language. 
One of the side effects will be that things like food and medical supply and education and shelter and transportation will all become much more affordable to all of us, not just the rich people. 
We are the stories we tell, we're the stories we're told. 
I found this passion not far from here, actually, when I was nine years old. 
So our job is to watch for these desire paths emerging, and, where appropriate, pave them, as someone did here. 
The main question that I've been asked since I arrived at this conference when I said I would talk about infidelity is, for or against? 
Now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent 17 percent, I think should enjoy it until it lasts. 
There was a Baskin-Robbins in my hometown, and they served ice cream from behind the counter in these giant, five-gallon, cardboard tubs. 
I think we could roll the tape, admin. 
And in fact, it heats the water a lot more quickly. 
This is a 32-million-pound flagship academy school which was built quite recently in the U.K. and designed by one of Britain's top architects. 
Messages started coming in. 
You read about it, you hear about it. 
It was tough, and those were some tough years. 
The American Physical Society had this beautiful poster encouraging students of color to become physicists. 
You still have the lobe of people involved with government, newspapers, politics, columnists. 
(Laughter) Now, cannabis is made up of hundreds of different chemicals, but two of those chemicals are by far the most interesting. 
It makes it adversarial; it's polarizing. 
Because the female parts of the brain are better connected, they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think, put them into more complex patterns, see more options and outcomes. 
I swear, the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made tasted totally different because we made them for our guests. 
In this meeting, there is a man standing in front of them, telling them, "We know who you are, we know who you will vote for, and if you're not going to drop the right paper, we're going to take revenge." 
I hear education systems are failing, but I believe they're succeeding at what they're built to do -- to train you, to keep you on track, to track down an American dream that has failed so many of us all. 
And the situation is getting worse. 
In the first year, his goal was 20 million users and he missed it. 
(Laughter) We do it because it eliminates what I believe to be one of the greatest tragedies of mankind, and that is people arrogantly, naïvely holding opinions in their minds that are wrong, and acting on them, and not putting them out there to stress test them. 
In fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment. 
And what goes on in the future? 
So, tiny fragments we actually managed to put back in the right place. 
You will find humans chasing higher education. 
And I'd like to point out that I wasn't using any special equipment, just my laptop and a really simple webcam. 
If you line up the entire text of "Moby Dick," which was published in 1851, into a giant rectangle, you may notice some peculiar patterns, like these words, which seem to predict the assassination of Martin Luther King, or these references to the 1997 death of Princess Di. 
But I have to choose option two every day. 
What we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium -- a multi-drug-resistant pathogenic bacterium -- in the same time we give our anti-quorum-sensing molecule, in fact, the animal lives. 
Our current understanding of the natural world on the quantum level breaks down at what’s known as the planck scale. 
So it's a bit different these days, and there are also acres of junk.

What if I was to tell you that some early Christians who lived in the desert believed that flying demons who mainly came out at lunchtime could infect them with an emotion they called "accidie," a kind of lethargy that was sometimes so intense it could even kill them? 
Only half of the developing countries have systematic learning assessment at primary school, and even less so at lower secondary school. 
When my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo, whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive electronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me. 
You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want. 
Poems and legends of the time told of laborers buried in nearby mass graves, or even within the wall itself. 
There was a great TED moment -- I think it was Sir Ken Robinson, was it? 
But they consider it part of their education, too, which is nice. 
And this was collected by Anupam -- which is like, finally in the end, he will not have anything, because it will evaporate. 
So, 100 billion galaxies, 13.7 billion light years away -- a step in size from that to Monterey, actually, is about the same as from Monterey to these things. 
(Laughter) And I thought, "How could I not have known this before? 
I've been pretending to be a man that I'm not my entire life. 
(Laughter) Traffic will be functionally exuberant. 
Long lines with hundreds of hooks or huge nets round up massive amounts of fish, along with other species, like seabirds, turtles, and dolphins. 
What do I mean by violence against children? 
And if you go to 1989 -- something that basically you don't expect that anybody's going to criticize -- but many are going to tell you, "Listen, it was the end of the Cold War that tore the social contract between the elites and the people in Western Europe." 
It's as if there has been a centuries old conspiracy amongst teachers and students to accept that heart function cannot be demonstrated. 
But let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral, because I think it's, as I said, the most -- this is the main reading room -- the most unique part of the building. 
The problems, actually, for this kind of case come manyfold from decades of scientific research involving human memory. 
And he'll improvise entire concerts off the top of his head, and he'll never play it exactly the same way again, so as a form of intense creativity, I think this is a great example. 
This was the boat, it was made quickly, obviously. 
Everyone I talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of Adrienne Rich, who, in "Dreams of a Common Language," wrote, "We are out in a country that has no language, no laws. 
Our strategy also relies on the experience and the wisdom and the leadership of those who have experienced this injustice firsthand. 
I'm a self-taught cellist, I've never had a lesson. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So here we are again. 
These are all real examples of projects that people, including myself, are working on right now, using AI. 
Stefan Sagmeister: Thank you. 
This is just archaic, primitive common sense, and by using common sense, we went from 120 kilowatts per square meter per year, which is the typical energy consumption for cooling a glass tower, to 40 kilowatts per square meter per year. 
So pick one idea, and make it the through-line running through your entire talk, so that everything you say links back to it in some way. 
They have fun in the moment and they keep playing in the sand. 
So we changed that and put, "This is the famous Budweiser house. We don't know of any other house ..." 
Mark became the first person to personally own an exo, and since then, he and the robot have walked over one million steps. 
TB: When you fail your maths A level, that's not going to shorten your life by 10 years. 
1974, we were down to five countries. 
Every once in a while, I get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional. 
They were all holding their photo as a statement. 
SK: Think about the things that we need to change. 
So today, I invite you to follow me on those three steps. 
And by the way, most of these exoplanets, we don't know too much about. 
And how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality. 
I talked to African-American women, Asian-American women, Native-American women, Caucasian women, Jewish women. 
And while we were climbing Hyperion, Marie Antoine spotted an unknown species of golden-brown ant about halfway up the trunk. 
He's kind of just out there making a living. 
Industrial machines are being equipped with a growing number of electronic sensors that allow them to see, hear, feel a lot more than ever before, generating prodigious amounts of data. 
And many of you, I'm sure, have thought about that and puzzled over it. 
(Applause) Now this particular transformation did not change the area of the original figure, so a six-year-old who plays with this has just discovered a clever algorithm to compute the area of any given parallelogram. 
Melanie picks up another lamb, puts it on the post, band goes on the tail, band goes on the scrotum. 
I know what the most dangerous thing is that I've ever done because NASA does the math. 
Normal, natural emotions are now seen as good or bad. 
And I'd put them in contact with people I knew personally so that they could not only have this safe space to feel human again, but so they could also have the resources they needed in affording their treatment. 
So let's run this and see if it works. 
It's affecting our brain as well. 
Back in 2003, the UK government carried out a survey. 
They were shrinking vacuum tubes, making them smaller and smaller. 
If we look at Islamists, if we look at the phenomenon of far-right fascists, one thing they've been very good at, one thing that they've actually been exceeding in, is communicating across borders, using technologies to organize themselves, to propagate their message and to create truly global phenomena. 
This starts to tell you about the mechanism by which we can tell stories and transmit information. 
This is the scene in Iceland the day after we published. 
So I was thinking, but when you look at the past, the way to understand the past is only by the traces available, because we cannot go back [to] the past. 
If you don't believe in a religion, there's nothing wrong with picking and mixing, with taking out the best sides of religion. 
It was almost two years later when I realized what this person should be called. 
And I don't think this will let up any time soon. 
But my addiction did. 
And when I started out, I thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff. 
And lastly, I want to share with you a project that we're currently working on, and I think it will force us all to remember in a really different way. 
(Laughter) "The Voice of Reason." 
I learned very few things in addition since (Laughter) -- but made a whole number of them into projects since. 
The space age began 50 years ago in October, and that’s exactly what Sputnik looked like. 
And we've also shrunk it so that the core emotion engine works on any mobile device with a camera, like this iPad. 
Seventy percent of Earth is covered with water. 
This is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border. 
Your ambition is satisfied, but it's very beautiful. 
But what about the self? 
It's this non-tracking collector with these six tuba-like horns, and each of them collect light in the following way -- if the sunlight strikes right here, it might bounce right to the center, the hot spot, directly, but if the sun is off axis and comes from the side, it might hit two places and take two bounces. 
For example, fish forms can be captured by coordinates and transformed to reveal major pathways of change and trends through time. 
Did anybody think while I was playing, "Why is he using so many impulses?" 
So that is the House of Tata. 
You have to work with your hands. 
So we need some help there. 
And you know what? It gets even more crazy. 
For my second project, I have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before. 
Here we were at every annual step through our first hundred years. 
And this is still going on. 
And here we're worrying about climate change and global warming. 
In this, I was interested in the consequences of geography and imagining how the world would be different if Israel were in Uganda, which is what these maps demonstrate. 
So we'll stick with the normal one for now, and I'm going to give you 30 seconds, every thumb into the node, connect the upper and the lower levels, you guys go on down there. 
Bad sound, the signal's weak, the software stinks. 
And that, fittingly enough, is called the diluent gas supply. 
Because the moment that people are alone, even for a few seconds, they become anxious, they panic, they fidget, they reach for a device. 
Working together is what changes our world. 
(Laughter) However, subjecting myself to that interrogation -- I answered all their questions, and I guessed on quite a few but I got them right -- and I finally landed the lab space I needed. 
Now, on the other hand, in the second half of the 20th century, the arts are frequently said to be in decline. 
(Laughter) So, finally, there were whale-sized fishes, and modern fishes mobbed corals, made gigantic by using their captured algae to eat sunshine. 
I'm a veteran of the starship Enterprise. 
And here, again, in the absence of regulation, what we're going to see is modifications to the product and product design to respond to the health concerns of the day. 
What if, instead of spending our lives doing, doing, doing, performing, performing, performing, we spent more time exploring, asking, listening, experimenting, reflecting, striving and becoming? 
Question: forty years ago, 1978, China sets out on its march to the market. 
Some can glide as flat as 60 feet forward for every foot of descent. 
I mean, Adam Smith, already writing in the late 18th century, said, "The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe." 
It will make you immortal. 
In non-professional circles outside America, it's largely ignored. 
Two other times, I show up and help my team with the preparation and cleanup. 
Perhaps good cigars? 
So, by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history, Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human. 
And everybody will welcome you. 
So instead of just butchering the body, I'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections. 
We've learned an amazing amount. 
So here is the thing. 
(Laughter) (Applause) In that way, I completed my college. 
But it creates this unfortunate situation where a tiny, tiny fraction of the world can actually participate in this exploration or can benefit from that technology. 
(Laughter) So we, together with a lot of villages, we began to talk about how to really address this situation of sanitation. 
It was total oblivion. 
Since patients wouldn't know whether they'd received the real thing or a dud, the results wouldn't be biased, researchers believed. 
Luckily, we can address all of these things in a variety of ways without scaring away our most vulnerable populations. 
Because with our own little telescope, just in the next two years, we'll be able to identify at least 60 of them. 
But we've also discovered, when it comes to plants, in plants, as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes, it is the ecosystem around them, it is the microbes that live in their root systems, that have just as much impact on the character of those plants as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves. 
We always had books before we had a second pair of shoes, and that was very important. 
(Laughter) But unfortunately, you have to experience the actual hotel, airline and hospital, and then you have that disconnect. 
Seems impossible but it isn't. 
TZ: Indeed, yes. 
The silkworm first attaches itself to the environment -- it creates a tensile structure -- and it then starts spinning a compressive cocoon. 
The thing is we cannot afford to give up on each other or on our kids, even if they've given up on us. 
All the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down. 
I like to create a timeline showing how the world came to be. 
The next video is not done by us. 
Wait till you see, maybe next year, what kind of windows we've invented. 
And you're usually paying something like 40 bucks a month. 
Me was composed of stories, of cravings, of strivings, of desires of the future. 
We don't measure how much a country spends on healthcare, we measure the length and quality of people's lives. 
Who is going to raise their hand and say, "I want to hear what you're doing next," and sell something to them. 
On the other hand, some substances may just reflect more blue or red light efficiently. 
Group by broccoli, group by your favorite vegetable, something you can aspire to. 
True communication increases understanding and creates a more caring and compassionate world. 
No doctor, can I remember, ever asking me, "Where have you lived?" 
And so she watched this TED Talk, and she went back the next day, she took the job, she went home, and she handed her husband the grocery list. (Laughter) And she said, I can do this. 
He had such paralyzing separation anxiety that we couldn't leave him alone. 
It's the only profession where you have to believe in the future. 
And there's the sheep. 
Because even what has been happening up 'til now with the Spinternet and authoritarian deliberation, there is a great chance that those voices will not be heard. 
Forty percent of people experience clinically measurable depression. 
Data is transported by the light, encoded in subtle changes of the brightness. 
In my previous job, I was the most senior woman in the Middle East, so one could think that investing in my network of female colleagues couldn't bring many benefits and that I should instead invest my time developing my relationships with male seniors and peers. 
What if it had happened before? How would I find out? 
So if we'd chosen that path, our evolutionary path would have led into the forest -- and been a short one indeed. 
And here's this incredibly simple molecule, a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together, and yet these are hugely important for [unclear] our low blood pressure, for neurotransmission, for many, many things, but particularly cardiovascular health. 
(Applause) (Applause ends) And my final time was 14 hours and 39 minutes. 
The second thing that my son has given me is he's given me my mission in life. 
And six months later, we sat down at Kennedy Space Center. 
Once the tau proteins start clumping together, they cause more clumps to form and continue to spread throughout the brain, even after head impacts have stopped. 
Every time we interact with someone, that experience enters the ladder at the bottom. 
Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen. 
The young accused the old. 
We can't blanket-say that they don't affect kids. 
So if you look that up, you can hear more of those tunes. 
But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the deserts. 
Each cubicle is dark and dingy, identified with a painted number on the wall, and partitioned by plywood and a curtain. 
I laid our towels down just out of reach of the surf and fell asleep. 
Look here -- you have to end poverty, education, gender, child and maternal health, control infections, protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade. 
And we've offered high blood pressure screening and counseling to each and every one of them. 
So what I want to do today is, first of all, talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right. 
If you have access to emergency medical services, call them. 
But there are solutions. 
Now, I know you're thinking, "There are no glaciers at Big Sur." 
And to do this, we had to basically come up with an experiment in which we could have people generate their own mind-wandering. 
Next line of code, TACGGGG: make a flower that's white, that blooms in the spring, that smells like this. 
Among the most frequent responses was liberty and justice. 
Now why is that? 
A brother- or sisterly cohesiveness makes them like family. 
When you come back out, you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes, so that no one knows how you voted. 
But it's much more than that. 
(Applause) He has become a bit of a media star because he goes to the film openings, and he knows how to work an audience now. 
They are: the arts and parenting. 
But it was also the signal that capped the use, or overuse, of energy-consuming devices. 
Well in this case, I emailed the poet a draft of my talk and she said, "Yeah, yeah, that's about it." 
Almost seven in 10 people who are released from prison will be rearrested in a constant cycle of crime and incarceration. 
Out of all the women I met, Fayza from Yemen affected me the most. 
This folder has 17,000 photos -- over 20 gigabytes of information -- and it's growing constantly. 
We went on the deck and turned our torches on and off to attract the attention of any passing boat. 
That creates a problem for standard metrics, because we're getting more and more stuff for free, like Wikipedia, Google, Skype, and if they post it on the web, even this TED Talk. 
The next thing I know, the ad is gone, no explanation. 
It's like a revival, tent-like festival, not unlike the civil rights movement teach-ins. 
We have oxytocin that connects us to others, makes us feel what they feel. 
Here they peddle their attack software and share information on new attack techniques. 
We can't solve all the problems by looking only at the oceans, but if we don't understand the fundamental life support system of this planet much more thoroughly than we do now, then the stresses that we will face, and that Cody will face, and even Nancy, who's going to live till she's 98, will have really problems coping. 
It's so far underwater right now, the only part that's showing pretty much is the cabin. 
Now, the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way. 
I say that because these are difficult patients. 
Later on, it was Florida A M University that first introduced me to organizing. 
It is our duty to leave a legacy of hope and opportunity for them but also with them. 
It was a great event. 
That's what I set out to do. 
It's then sold and bought, and it's then delivered to me. 
(Laughter) Anyway. 
But your face was absolutely straight when you twisted the lid down on the round tin where the matches, you said, are always stowed. 
We aren't machines. 
Now, the brain may not look like much from the outside -- a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh, amorphous. 
When we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists, everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks and crackpots. Now it's got a title. Everyone's doing it. 
All we had was some tan girls, girls who felt the need to be under the sun. 
These are scans from Judy Rapoport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia, and you can see already in the top there's areas that are red or orange, yellow, are places where there's less gray matter, and as they followed them over five years, comparing them to age match controls, you can see that, particularly in areas like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus, there's a profound loss of gray matter. 
And this is exactly the type of cooperation and willingness to set aside differences that we are going to need. 
Once he traveled across the country to follow a forest fire, hunted it with his camera for a week. 
And they, according to the research, make the best business leaders. 
I was coming at it from a different perspective, where I was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem. 
Species have nowhere to migrate in a system like this, obviously. 
Essential amino acids are called essential because we can't synthesize them in our bodies. 
Now I can feel a sensation of delight and beauty if I look at that eye. 
Do you see where I'm going with this? 
So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness, where I saw people living that way, and just looked at those. 
And when I checked the figures, I discovered that Ebbw Vale actually has one of the lowest rates of immigration in the country. 
And we believe that these responses in higher-order areas are induced or become similar across listeners because of the meaning conveyed by the speaker, and not by words or sound. 
So we decided to use our puff-o-mat and our automated tracking software to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs. 
This is actually a picture of Hal, my coauthor. 
My father, a secret agent? 
(Applause) Thelma Nichols: Inmate number 0B2472. 
In this case, I was writing a story that included some kind of detail, period of history, a certain location. 
Where the blanks are in medicine can be just as important as the words that we use in these conversations. 
Don't let anyone tell you they understand electricity. 
CA: So how on earth did you get access to this drug? 
This trailer housed two turntables, mixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system. 
And behind this there will be a huge set of points that could become possible at some later stages. 
Because these products are always changing, everything that I've designed in my career is pretty much gone, and everything that I will design will fade away. 
In each of these cases, a realistic and gritty but determined, stubborn optimism was not the result of success. 
And I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein, who, I believe, has paid his dues. 
And Kay doesn't know how to cope with her emotions in the right way, so her backpack becomes bigger and bigger until it bursts, and she finally is forced to overcome her own struggles. 
The pattern itself is the message. 
So I got all these magic tricks. Here. I'll show you. 
Okay, we can do that. 
The way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it. 
You can see how well that turned out a century later." 
Well, there is still a lot to explore in its early days. And there's not many people working in this field. 
But I don't know yet how this develops over a lifetime. 
You know the Soviet architecture of that building is the conservation. 
María Rachid (Spanish): I always say that, in reality, the effects of marriage equality are not only for those couples that get married. 
The fetus adjusts its metabolism and other physiological processes in anticipation of the environment that awaits it. 
But I knew that was not possible. 
Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction of the money on ocean exploration that we've spent on space exploration. 
Something never mentioned in the dozens of books about horses and their riders I devoured in those days. 
He couldn't imagine a future where he wasn't in trouble. 
So that was kind of a clue that things weren't right. 
I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this. 
They're best known as the inventors of chemically-based hair creams and heat straightening tools designed to permanently, or semipermanently, alter the texture of black hair. 
(Laughter) I mean, the Scandinavian decadence was mesmerizing. 
Can we figure out a way, since we know we won't have enough masks because we don't make them in America anymore, they're all made in China -- do we need N95? A state-of-the-art, top-of-the-line, must-be-fitted-to-your-face mask? 
But this was not to last. 
What we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy. 
At one point a nurse, without any prompt, turned to us and said, "I always think to myself, 'I wish I had become an architect, because I could have designed rooms like this better.'" I said to her, "An architect did design this room." 
A forest can be an integral part of our urban existence. 
And when Watson and Crick in the '50s first decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule -- very long, complicated molecule -- we then started on this journey to understand that inside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics, our traits, what we inherit, what diseases we may get. 
You know it costs a lot of money and so on, but yes, it should not play it safe. 
And so what you see in all three of these places, in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City, are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking. 
We now have 5,300. 
We are now interdependent. 
We have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance -- very energizing -- having in change this transportation of the pollen. 
And I suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well, but somehow it doesn't happen with the same intensity. 
Do you remember when you first realized that your computer was more than just a monitor and keyboard? 
That's the first thing we can do. 
I'd like to sing in Basque, which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live, in the region in France and Spain. 
They just don't do that in that industry. 
So these black boxes that we live with and take for granted are actually complex things made by other people, and you can understand them. 
Now, the second reason relates to Tonya's comments about having had excellent performance evals, great feedback from her teams, and having taken every management training program she can lay her hands on. 
But now, it was having the opposite effect. 
So how can you make solar cells more accessible and for everyone, and not only for the people that can afford a sustainable lifestyle? 
SD: First, I would give anything to be in that spaceship. 
Or denies you of family, of friend or home. 
Scientists started mastering the techniques for reading DNA. 
So I can say this: It's not the hundreds of reasons why one can't be an artist, but rather, the one reason one must be that makes us artists. 
It felt as comfortable and natural as a walk in the park, which is what most folks were doing in Yosemite that day. 
But now they've got ways of doing it, and they've become so efficient. 
And it's right in the middle of the city. 
Well, in both cases, the thing that is construed as being affected is expressed as the direct object, the noun after the verb. 
And so I had to develop this new intuition, that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space. 
And one guy in particular, Bob Singleton, asked me a question I'm going to leave with us today. 
And the good news about this is that we can change this by acknowledging it. 
So we had this speaker set up, and we had the camera facing it, and lots of lights pointing at the speaker, and I would set up the speaker, put the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker, and we would do this over and over again, and it was until midday that I realized that I had a completely red face because of the lights pointing at the speaker. 
Now it's a little bit of a surprise that to get an answer to that question, we have to go to tool use in the chimpanzees. 
And by working with journalists, by giving all of my information back to the American people, rather than trusting myself to make the decisions about publication, we've had a robust debate with a deep investment by the government that I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone. 
Humanity had to learn about measuring roughness. 
And the life started to come, and I had a big wish to come back to photography, to photograph again. 
And this robot is a little bit of a show-off. 
Shortly after the tsunami I read a newspaper article written by the Archbishop of Canterbury -- fine title -- about the tragedy in Southern Asia. 
CA: OK, so rising immigration and fears about that are one of the causes of the current divide. 
Now there are many, many more tools of foresight I would love to share with you, and they come from all kinds of places: investment firms that look beyond near-term stock prices, states that have freed their elections from the immediate interests of campaign financiers. 
The ancient understanding that underneath their separate identities, all animals are one, has been a powerful inspiration to me. 
And what I love about this example is beyond changing the paradigm of the teacher. 
They get absorbed and the energy they are carrying is turned into heat. 
That is a forecast that I made six years ago that growth would slow down to 1.3 percent. 
This is happening to the guy who washed the dishes in the fancy restaurant you went to last week. 
This is not that common. 
Now at that time, there was a great, as you can imagine, frustration -- let's call it frustration -- it started to grow very, very quickly. 
(Applause) Then they print it out with a big machine, and then, when it's ready to send back to Vienna or wherever you are -- via post -- then they put in the electronics. 
With this idea in mind, I created Power Plant. 
My parents made sure that I grew up on a kind of steady ground that allows one to question and risk and leap. 
These are five-kiloton yield bombs, about the size of small Volkswagens; it would take 800 to get into orbit. 
We want them to aim for the greatest health impact. 
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have, which is the choice overload problem. 
They're called Millennium Development Goals. 
And we've spent a lot of time in the field. It's been a fantastic amount of work. 
It is asset optimization and system optimization. 
I would never use these tools to deliver my baby, I thought. 
They think they're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose a little more than the one they left behind. 
Haven't said anything about e-cigarettes. 
They require very similar mathematics. 
What'd he say? He said what surgeons always say: "We got it all." 
I think I can comply with these very difficult treatments. 
(Laughter) And that's true. 
So I took heart in seeing that. 
We also just went back and looked at a lot of their previous paperwork to try and really understand; to try and diagnose what bodily malfunctions had occurred that lead to that 136th spot on the World Bank list. 
Instead of which, I didn't say, "Please." 
So we formed a start-up company to bring this technology to the market and impact people's lives. 
(Laughter) Wrong. 
Ladies and gentleman, "Sura Yako." 
And of course, the ambiguous figures that seem to flip-flop back and forth. 
This is why we can lift heavy objects without breaking our skin, but a tiny needle can make us bleed with just a little poke. 
Yael Eisenstat: I'll speak into the box. 
At that red line, there is a change. 
(Laughter) Therefore, only another desiring conscience can conceive me as a desirable being. 
I think we all, if we don't look at the data, we underestimate the tremendous change in Asia, which was in social change before we saw the economic change. 
You know, as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps, and I think we all see a lot of gaps. 
And he looked at me, and I smiled, and then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes. 
Another version of the Mozart myth is that listening to Mozart can make you not only cleverer but healthier, too. 
And astronomers said, if the Earth is moving and we look at a prominent star, let's say, Sirius -- well I know I'm in Manhattan so you guys can't see the stars, but imagine you're out in the country, imagine you chose that rural life — and we look at a star in December, we see that star against the backdrop of distant stars. 
When you walked into those rooms, they smelled really bad, and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before. 
Music makes us smarter and healthier and happier. 
If you imitate something, maybe you can have an effect on it. 
This could be an instrument of repair. 
Thank you, thank you so much. 
In fact, they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile.

And I think, actually -- Thomas Schelling, one of the participants in the dream team, he put it very, very well. 
We are changing our culture from within, but at the same time we are reconnecting with our traditions. 
Three years later -- a lot of programming, working with other graduate students in the lab -- Kismet was ready to start interacting with people. 
And on the eastern end of the island, where the reefs are intact and thriving, you could barely tell a tropical storm had passed. 
In the Iraq War, at the beginning of the first Iraq War, the U.S. military, the air force, sent two squadrons of F-15E Fighter Eagles to the Iraqi desert equipped with these five million dollar cameras that allowed them to see the entire desert floor. 
At twelve, she begged her mother for a typewriter after enduring a campy science fiction film called "Devil Girl From Mars." 
Here's an example of one of these objects. 
It's changing our relationship to the health care system. 
And another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen. 
Whereas modern nations are imagined communities, in the sense that I don't even know all these people. 
I'm going to, instead, in a minute or two, show you an early, crude video because I think it's a better way to tell a story. 
And the amazing thing about this really insidious technological innovation is that even just with this one thing, we can experience a huge range of regret. 
But as soon as the bowl entered their home, it flew to Bai Su Zhen’s head and trapped her inside. 
But if you're not a native speaker, you have to pass a test. 
So it moves eight or nine millimeters, produces 25 watts. 
Ezra: My name is Ezra Gelehun. 
And for certain bacteria we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore. 
Have you ever put on a pair of pants and then much later realized that there was a loose sock smushed up against your thigh? 
And I asked her the questions that grown-ups ask kids, like, "What is your favorite subject?" 
And thank goodness that women haven't done that. 
All you do is nuke it. What could be better? 
"Bless you, man." 
Origami is a versatile platform for designers. 
I went online, and there I learned about how multispectral imaging had been used to recover two lost treatises of the famed Greek mathematician Archimedes from a 13th-century palimpsest. 
And how did we do that? 
But what if our teacher introduced a story from the present day, for example, how Treniya told us in Pittsburgh that -- PV: "My sister was scrolling through Facebook and typed in our last name. 
Many animals gather in large groups that are among the most wonderful spectacles in the natural world. 
[Pumpkin Trash Break] (Laughter) [Peanut Butter Slime] [Strawberry Cream Disease] (Laughter) These flavors are not delicious, as we might have hoped they would be. 
Did reading save his life? 
Some of them are quite wholesome-looking young kids' entertainers. 
Is this headed here, where we can have distributed systems with the right infrastructure to provide power for our hospitals and our schools? 
Now, what is Roz Picard, an AI researcher, doing here telling you about SUDEP, right? 
Now, don't be confused about Bitcoin -- Bitcoin is an asset; it goes up and down, and that should be of interest to you if you're a speculator. 
And I said to her, "I don't understand why you're not a feminist, because, you know, you live in America." 
OK. 
And I always say to the students and post-docs I lecture to, don't be arrogant, because arrogance kills curiosity. 
You can flip through a dictionary and choose words at random. 
A couple of years ago, a group of us in Canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish in our various silos. 
And in fact, we did sometimes do physics together. 
If you add up the deficits that all of the utilities run in Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, you get to a number of 21 billion dollars every year to maintain that system and keep it going. 
Why do our cities look like this? 
Keith played out my mother's life. 
So -- (Applause) So you may ask yourself, who is this dude? 
We did get it to work eventually, after tweaking a bit here and there. 
Her name was Joan, and she was a mother to me. 
This is so ubiquitous now. 
Unfortunately, we cannot send probes in the scorching hot atmosphere of the Sun, where temperatures can rise up to around 10 million degrees Kelvin. 
We've recruited a team of scientific rivals, the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses for what's at the heart of this epidemic. 
This is another example of a project that somebody at Google was really passionate about, and they just, they got going, and it's really, really a great product, and really taking off. 
(Laughter) She has thought and she has felt, and it's really not more complicated than that. 
Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are already higher than they've been for millions of years. 
But then, when you think about it, it's obvious -- because nationalism has no solution to climate change. 
That's still just one percent of the total population. 
And imagine how this could revolutionize the way we manage allergies and chronic disease. 
It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community. 
(Laughter) What does it mean to be yourself? 
And if girls grow up in a world that tells them that they are designed just a bit crazier than the boys, then isn't that a little bit like telling them that they are born less capable of rationality than men, less capable of reason and unworthy of the same intellectual respect as their brothers. 
Now we rationally know that an economy built on hyper-consumption is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards. 
First is just the rise of the fact that Zagat's has actually moved out of and diversified from rating restaurants, into actually rating health care. 
You needed to know that. 
And then we would size all the other elements -- the different commercial elements: hotel, luxury housing, offices and so forth -- and dump it on top. 
For many people the book was a call to regulate substances capable of catastrophic harm. 
They were a highly intelligent species. 
We're also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon. 
This is the Verzuz Effect. 
First, we've got population. 
Charles Bonnet said, 250 years ago -- he wondered how, thinking of these hallucinations, how, as he put it, the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain. 
In 1896, she appeared at the founding convention of the National Association of Colored Women in Washington D.C. 
And Nature Magazine had a piece surveying the loss of wildlife, and it said, "If all of those 23,000 went extinct in the next century or so, and that rate of extinction carried on for more centuries and millennia, then we might be at the beginning of a sixth extinction. 
For example, this panic switch shuts off the coil runner’s engine. 
How can they insist on this treatment at the end? 
It keeps on occurring again and again, from many theories and many experiments, as a great example of the universality which is so dear to us mathematicians. 
He said, "If the one tribe included a great number of courageous, sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other, this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other." 
We had less than two hours two-way communication with the outside world in two months. 
And if they're 50 light years away, and we call them up, and you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then 50 years later it comes back and they say, Please repeat? 
It has to be part of the explanation. 
We can't change the world overnight for our children, but we can give them a safe and private place to escape that world, if only for just a minute. 
Now it's not resolved at all. 
There is no space there. 
Born in Dublin, Beckett studied English, French and Italian before moving to Paris, where he spent most of his life writing theatre, poetry and prose. 
And it does not value, as a company, transparency. 
The threat had gone away. 
I thought, okay, I will go out. 
(Laughter) So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people. 
And thick thighs, you are just so sexy, you can't stop rubbing each other. 
Now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin. 
This may be surprising. 
But why? 
DB: And failing. 
And the two here are just examples. 
They didn't find it. 
These paintings are thought to be round about 9,000 to 11,000 years old. 
The problem with technologies like this is that if one looks at proteins in the body, there are 11 orders of magnitude difference between the high-abundant and the low-abundant proteins. 
Next, we must disseminate what we learn. 
No one was ever sentenced for these crimes. 
I had intended to write a constructive, multi-layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women. 
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb") And we can recover speech as well. 
He sees physical laws as being like divine commands. 
This pirate is called Joshua. 
I challenge each and every one of you to mentor someone different. 
How do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion? 
It's enough to think that the movies like "The Terminator" or "The Matrix" are nonfiction. 
So we didn't know what to do, but we decided to cast a very wide net. 
I started to write about things I recognized. 
Nine months later I found myself spraying messages in Tahrir Square. The reason for this act was this image that I saw in my newsfeed. 
In fact, without the optimism bias, we would all be slightly depressed. 
And of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans. 
That's almost the size of South America. 
It protects you from the world around you, and from yourself. 
In fact, as we looked at most prosperous countries today, what we found was, they were able to reduce corruption as they became prosperous -- not before. 
My friends who found me thought I was dead. 
I believe that God is all-powerful, but he's not a micromanager. 
Of course, architecture is about function, but I want to remember a rewriting of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi, and I want to propose a completely different quality. 
In addition to their speed, the professor's equipped them with a few other incredible features. 
I want an iPhone. 
There's just a deep layer of gas that gets denser and denser with depth. 
And there’s nothing special about 725. 
Quite the opposite. 
And under 100 percent sea ice in the dead of winter, bowhead whales are singing. 
There were flexible, clear blood vessels. 
It's the equivalent of a mountain three kilometers high, sitting on a soccer field. 
We caught it with that low-tech raft — (Laughter) — and it was carrying six tons of cocaine. 
There are more than 36 million people who have been internally displaced around the world. 
And climate migration is just one small part, but it's going to have ripple effects in both coastal cities and cities in the interior. 
(Laughter) So in that example, OK, there are a few extra steps, I admit. 
And not only do the refugees live in very dramatic circumstances inside those countries, but the local communities themselves are suffering, because salaries went down, because there are more unemployed, because prices and rents went up. 
I'll get your postman making dinner plans. 
But through the campaign, these injustices were framed as not just news stories, they were firsthand experiences that had affected real people, who were creating, with the solidarity of others, what they needed and had previously lacked: a platform to speak out, the reassurance they weren't alone or to blame for what happened to them and open discussions that would help to reduce stigma around the issue. 
This adult pierces the thrips, sucking it within just several minutes, going to the other prey, continuing all over the place. 
So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour, he finally said, "So, Miss Yang, do you have any questions to ask me?" 
Now picture yourself for a second in the middle of the Australian Outback. 
My students come from war-torn countries. 
I mean, like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me, she's like, 'She's just talking; she's just being nice to you. She's not going to do that.' "And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet. 
And you don't have to be building memory palaces or memorizing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works. 
So what's to account for that difference and how did our skin come to take on so many different hues to begin with? 
(Laughter) "I want to see if I can, you know -- I need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices, see what drills you do and whatever." 
I have a forest in the backyard of my own house. 
A friend came to see me last year -- and she doesn't mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year and said, "Nigel, I've read your book. 
The boy is wearing his favorite t-shirt given to him as a gift by his father after a trip to Sydney, and you and I can all tell how happy he is and what's exactly on his mind at that moment. 
You turn on the loudspeaker, and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets, the sound just kind of goes where it wants. 
There was another one of those comb jellies. 
Now, fortunately, technology has come a long way, and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework. 
When I was 14, I was asked to seriously consider a career path. 
So I called her. 
Sometimes we're willing participants in deception for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret, secret. 
But only in the last 120 years, people started, or people knew more and more how to exploit, or how to use, this biological control phenomenon, or in fact, natural control phenomenon, for their own needs. 
Suddenly I realized that Humanae was useful for many people. 
What you're doing, right now, at this very moment, is killing you. 
What could I possibly reply? 
So on behalf of little Masa and on behalf of Doaa and of Bassem and of those 500 people who drowned with them, can we make sure that they did not die in vain? 
Amongst these million individuals, most of them are healthy and some of them will have the disease. 
She had decided to move to the West Coast to be closer to her children, and she didn't want a long-distance relationship. 
My mother died, a relationship I'd been in ended, I moved back to the United States from some years abroad, and I got through all of those experiences intact. 
(Laughter) We do this all the time in English: Words like "heartbroken," "bookworm," "sandcastle" all are compounds. 
But they will do global economic damage, because they don't have to hit, necessarily, to do this kind of damage. 
And then I said, "Hey, you want me to bury you?" 
From observing that my deck had sun beating down on it on a cold day, stepping out in it, laying there, the warmth consuming my body. 
Tens? Hundreds? Thousands? 
We can't sustain suburbs, so let's design a building which gives the qualities of a house to each unit. 
(Laughter) Is that Mars Ya Marov? 
But people no longer think that. 
We can do this together. 
History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as -- who else? -- the world's first true inventor of the children's pop-up book. 
I don't have any patents, and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company, and I am not seeking your vote. 
And here I've taken away the robots, but basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward. 
Well we took the manuscript, and we decided to image it in X-ray fluorescence imaging. 
And with this one campaign as our umbrella, my organization, DATA, and other groups, have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm that's out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America. 
Instead of pushing water out, they used the channels to pull water back in. 
Within it, there was 80 knots of wind, which was far too much wind for the boat and I to cope with. 
So I never know who's going to be in the picture, if it's going to be a great sunrise or sunset -- no control. 
These technologies, combined with the extraordinary talents of teachers, provide an opportunity to revolutionize education. 
They made clear that a woman must not do a man's job. 
It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance. 
The size of a wave is called its wavelength, and how often it comes by is called its frequency. 
"All right. OK." 
But there's one thing that's even more important, and I think that's extinction. 
So a couple of key things that are important in having a 3D tunnel network. 
So in a program called Tag-A-Giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada, from Corsica to Spain. 
27 times 3,000 calculated equals 81,000 calculated slash 550 calories equals 147. 
So that's the end. 
I'm moving very quickly over a number of disciplines. In biology, the notions of symbiosis, group selection, evolutionary psychology are contested, to be sure. 
There are two ways of thinking about my work. 
I wanted you to see this gallery because it's as good as it gets. 
When you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA. 
All sides have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. 
(Laughter) "It's confusing everybody." 
Abuse could be affecting your daughter, your sister, your best friend right now. 
Interdependent leaders, on the other hand, understand that they need other people. 
But not just any steps -- the right steps for us. 
And then you have, of all things, the smell of a book. 
Let's visit where these creatures live, the northeast Amazon, home to the Akuriyo tribe. 
And of course, barring surgery, or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform how we look, and how we look, though it is superficial and immutable, has a huge impact on our lives. 
When Oshea was a teenager, he murdered Mary's only son, Laramiun Byrd, in a gang fight. 
Yossi Vardi: This is one of the most popular viral advertisement of last year, known as the optical inch by Philips. Let's applaud Philips -- (Applause) -- for this gesture for humanity. 
And so the doctor took them away, and lo and behold, the cancer is now completely gone. 
But there are really no simple answers to these questions. 
It would be like a tag team of specialists going up against the patient's pain. 
Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 With robo-ants ricocheting all over the habitat, it might seem impossible to stop them before they break free. 
The acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours. 
Okay? And all you have to guide you are your two eyes. 
Why do we travel too much? 
And as I looked down on the ground, I noticed there was some ants running around. 
YR: Exactly. There is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons: so I can repair it afterward and especially so nobody takes that, just on his head. 
It's about sharing. It's about honesty. It's about identity. 
In one study, researchers observed 260 students studying. 
One was the scanning of Babbage's archive. 
And it was at that time that my mother got word from the commune chief that the Vietnamese were actually asking for their citizens to go back to Vietnam. 
He heard Bobby's name, and he then truly realized what he had done. 
I've been teaching visual intelligence for over 15 years, and to my great amazement and astonishment -- to my never-ending astonishment and amazement, I have seen that looking at art with a critical eye can help to anchor us in our world of uncharted waters, whether you are a paramilitary trooper, a caregiver, a doctor or a mother. 
Because as we all know, our reefs are dying, and our oceans are in trouble. 
A lot of sexuality education that happens today is so influenced by the baseball model, and it sets up education that can't help but produce unhealthy sexuality in young people. 
And you get the impression in the news that they are after us in the West, but they are actually mainly after people from other Muslim backgrounds. 
We can make the circuitry of the right computational power, but we can't actually put them together to make something that will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems. 
It happened -- I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing, so sandals and sort of a white robe, you know, because again, the outer affects the inner. 
For example, the brain has the ability to pay attention to specific objects and events. 
Or authorities, being able to know the difference between someone having a mental health crisis and a different type of aggression, and responding accordingly. 
They're part of us now. 
Well, I don't know how many of you saw the China trip last week and the G20. 
And so, for the past six years, I've made it my personal mission to make sure that as many people as possible understand these types of technologies and their implications. 
One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize, was that we could use everyday gestures on data, like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid. 
Long before a little thing called Twitter, radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast. 
I was so excited, I almost wet myself. 
All in all, there's over 150 sites that are now tracking my personal information, most all of them without my consent. 
I should know because I was there on opening day. 
In HTML 5, digital Detroit gets replaced by this thing where every tweet is an app, every advertisement is an instance of a store. 
This is, in fact, the 13th floor of one of these terraces. 
But I'm going to segue to another thing that relates, because one of my private campaigns I've been conducting for over three and a half years is for transparency and accountability around the bailout of CL Financial. 
This statement sent shockwaves through the Western world, heightening the tension between the Soviet Union and the US who were in the thick of the Cold War. 
Steve, both a lawyer and a psychologist, has treated many patients with severe mental illness, and to this day he'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen. 
The War Relocation Authority relied on incarcerees to keep the camps running. 
They're soft, they're slimy, and I was fascinated by the way they use light in their environment, either to attract mates, for self-defense, or to attract food. 
In 1975, another big advance: you could peel back a tab and attach it to the lid itself. 
And some of the seats need to actually change their direction, and change their rake, to allow that to happen. 
We also know that we have to decarbonize our energy system. 
We often use quick and easy labels to describe our feelings. 
75 minutes. 
It's a mistake to think that in hard choices, one alternative really is better than the other, but we're too stupid to know which, and since we don't know which, we might as well take the least risky option. 
One's got to build a lot of technology. 
If we put our minds together and our resources together, and we openly talk about this, and try to find solutions for this epidemic that's going on in America, hopefully we can save a life. 
How do we uncouple this to make it nonpartisan?" 
Yeah, no, really, this was like aah -- why didn't I remember this? 
1,600 years before Columbus set sail, Eratosthenes not only realized the earth was round, but calculated its circumference and diameter within a few miles of their actual size. 
So I posed as a teacher and a missionary at an all-male university in Pyongyang. 
So, the sequel to "Elizabeth," "Golden Age." 
People lean back in their chairs, maybe impressed but not engaged. 
But heavy drinking can alter enzyme activity so more of that byproduct is produced, potentially causing liver damage even with what’s usually a safe dose of acetominophen. 
So it still didn't mean that he didn't do it, but we knew something was maybe fishy about this witness. 
Synthetic DNA is a commodity. 
CA: That was the good news. The bad news was that to do it, he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops. (Laughter) EM: I mean, you can certainly drive -- if you drive it 65 miles an hour, under normal conditions, 250 miles is a reasonable number. 
Today, humans eat only 40% of all cultivated corn, while the remaining 60% supports consumer good industries worldwide. 
After my year as Miss America, I continued to meet a lot of well-known people, including Donald Trump. 
The taste of my motherland, Turkey, is a mixture of sweet and bitter. 
In his time, burning fossil fuels for energy and for allowing economies to develop was accepted. 
But being pirates, none of them trust each other, so they can't collaborate in advance. 
And it takes several minutes to communicate a single sentence. 
Over the years, many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children, but often, one member of staff is caring for 10, 20, and even 40 children. 
And if you move in time from 20,000 years ago to the modern day, you see that temperature increased. 
You want 10 to 20. 
You know, if compassion is so good for us, I have a question. 
Thus we are told that "My mercy takes precedence over my anger." 
And finally, there were 600 respondents in that poll. 
A bomb fell not far from my car -- well, far enough, but big noise. 
That's how this and other Impressionist works use quickly executed prominent brushstrokes to capture something strikingly real about how light moves. 
It was labeled "low-performing and persistently dangerous" due to its low test scores and high number of weapons, drugs, assaults and arrests. 
And their experiences with families are so varied. 
You directly observe a few simple things. 
You just shone less light up into the sky. 
(Applause) And so, what I think is really intriguing about a community like 4chan is just that it's this open place. 
You have a pneumonia, you take penicillin, you kill the microbe and you cure the disease. 
(Laughter) And finally, you could advocate for this. 
(Laughter) The lower-level employees thought it was very funny. 
When you get sick, it is a bug in your genome. 
It had to be to live a good life, an adventurous life, a meaningful one. 
For example, in the Caucasus there's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools. 
When it moved into its new host, the Eastern Hemlock tree, it escaped its predators, and the new tree had no resistance to it. 
This audience includes many of the most creative minds on the planet, who get up in the morning and think not only about how to manage the world we have, but how to create worlds that should be. 
But it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm, from the current linear, command and control thinking, looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible, a much more adaptive approach, where we recognize that redundancy, both in social and environmental systems, is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change. 
And recently, there have been tales of another cosmic war, between gravity, which collapses the universe, and dark energy, which finally shreds it. 
Well, I can think of many examples where I felt like this. 
His father was an SOB, and, in fact, he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood, but then we were off and running. 
It can be achieved out of innocence, or arrogance, or out of selfishness, sometimes out of carelessness. 
And the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability to identify it as literally false. 
Some, it's quite hard to tell why. 
So these are the types of issues that we should be increasing our diplomacy, increasing our economic development aid. 
Any tough problem, I think it can be solved. 
It doesn't even occur to us that we should. 
So, here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid. 
So, at the center there, that's actually where most of the starlight comes out from. 
Now for as long as I can remember, my job has been to take people out into nature, and so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering. 
(Laughter) All right, good. 
Now I'm big on speaking to people's self-interest because we're all wired for that. 
And what, then, made that momentous difference? 
Now, we know that that's wrong. 
So if you think of naturally occurring CRISPR proteins as molecular scissors, you can think of base editors as pencils, capable of directly rewriting one DNA letter into another by actually rearranging the atoms of one DNA base to instead become a different base. 
So if you have the time, and I encourage you, please visit microsculpture.net and go and have a play. 
We then searched through 80 jurisdictions, it took us seven years, to find the jurisdiction where we wanted to begin filing our first suit. 
(Laughter) For one of the videos, we choreographed hundreds of people with umbrellas in an abandoned parking lot outside Tokyo, and then filmed them from a drone a half a mile in the air. 
So a lot is at stake. 
(Laughter) And I do solid science, I publish my results, my colleagues read them, I get citations of my work. 
Same thing: gave her a picture, she held it up to her forehead. 
And it's shown here in its true orientation. 
Apart from shared experiences, trial and error, conventional farming extension services are boots on the ground and radio -- expensive and hard to scale in the face of population growth. 
The prizes are based on just one criteria. It's very simple. 
Millions of people had emigrated, the economy was in a shambles, and it seemed all of a sudden that 30 years of development had been wiped out. 
And the big question, of course, is why? 
Man: Future's over here. Wind, sun, a new energy grid. 
In addition to donating their data, they need to donate their decision scientists. 
They feed on human blood. 
I invented Lifesaver bottle because I got angry. 
And I go on the podium. 
Almost one in four Americans has a tattoo, it's a multibillion-dollar industry, and whether you love tattoos or hate them, this talk will change the way you think about them. 
This can take us several months to complete. 
We have little option but to open this door. 
Again, it's being freely distributed. 
There are birds that pluck out feathers. 
If I try to move it out of the way, it fights me, and moves back to where it wants to be. 
They are objects of desire. 
This is worse than the Great Depression. 
But you go and look to the center of the galaxy, it's thousands of years ago. 
We're taught to hide so many parts of who we are and what we've been through: our love, our pain, for some, our faith. 
(Laughter) You'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans, or some such thing, which is quite absurd, of course. 
But that raises an interesting question. 
And right now, we cannot rule out the possibility of that happening in the future. 
Sounds pretty gloomy, doesn't it? 
(Laughter) Wipe my butt. 
But if that's true, why do some people, like the stranger who rescued me, do selfless things, like helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselves? 
Y'all don't know that? Protect and serve. 
Mission accomplished. 
That would take us a long step along the road to autonomous vehicles that drive as well as the best humans. 
I look at that picture now, and I think, you did not need a diet, you needed a fashion consult. 
That's the understanding, the rational understanding of our situation in the world that has led to these people being the most effective altruists in history, Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett. 
And do we want to live longer than we already do?

I wouldn't be sitting here right now if this hadn't happened. 
And when you think about it a little bit, it does make sense, because our brain is very isolated. 
You'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA. 
Everything is just fine under these circumstances. 
And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can, at least in principle, be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind -- neuroscience, psychology, etc. 
The ethicists and epidemiologists try to figure out how best to distribute medicine, and the hospitals and physicians are absolutely obsessed with their protocols and checklists, trying to figure out how best to safely apply medicine. 
I started working in the industry, but I wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear, extracting and manufacturing mode. 
Not this time of year -- it's more around October. 
It's not a bank. We had to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them -- by establishing management systems, by providing all that knowledge, how do you run a business on one side -- while they all know how to run, how to create content. 
Submit your own guess at what 2/3 of the new average will be by using the form below, and we’ll find out. 
And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately, is it will do a developmental computation, a molecular computation, and it'll build an electronic computer. 
And so there are three that I want to show you specifically. 
Many of our faith-based organizations have tremendous amounts of wealth that can be utilized for social change. 
The other thing is, you know, it would be even better if you didn't have to draw the blood. 
So this piece is caused by lower case letters followed by lower case letters inside of that contact list. 
But there is one more element, which is the benefits that technology can create, because it is not printed, static content. 
And she had a statement that is very profound, and this statement is that science has been able to find cures for many evils, but never the greatest evil of all in human beings, and that evil is apathy. 
But the most important thing here is that the very people who are supposed to defend us, the police, the military, are the ones that committed most of the crimes. 
We're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do in the next 5,000 days -- we're going to give this machine a body. 
So yes, fear was there, but I would take a good hard look at it, assess just how relevant it was and then put it where it belonged, which was more often than not behind my exhilaration, my anticipation and my confidence. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: I really like this metaphor. 
But here's another video that shows some of our challenges. 
And so was humor. 
And the light that falls onto our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world, not only the color of objects, but also the color of their illumination, and the color of the space between us and those objects. 
And I'm happy to report that many smart people at Google and Facebook are working on just that. 
People were dying in the streets. 
And I hope that you too find that there's more to design, and more towards the art of the design, than doing it yourself.

And we are good at training our warriors to fight. 
It was this reasoned, informed and strategic discussion that revealed the sad truth about the War on Drugs. 
So the main tank, the main critical thing, is this oxygen gas supply cylinder we have here. 
Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first, and other areas later. 
The most annoying thing in the world is when people want to touch the artwork.

And on coral reefs, where some of the main framework organisms disappear, we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity. 
(Applause) At the Academy Awards in LA, many of the pundits had written us off, but we felt that in order for the legislative push to continue, we needed that win. 
So therefore, the key thing to do is to get the cost of that initial installation low, and then get the cost of the financing low, because that interest -- those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar. 
Hiring survivors is another way that any company can help. 
And as you breathe, think about what is in your breath.

But then they have to let go and trust their teams to make the right decisions on how to get there. 
And they put the fish in this cubic fish tank. 
So this is the male seahorse. 
If he does the best he can, he will have no further obsessions, probably no depression, but his affect will be dulled, he will never go back to surgery, he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children, his life will be changed. 
The combination of all these parts, the input, the output and the AI, gives a net subjective experience of an interface inside your head that you could talk to in likeness to talking to yourself. 
From social media posts, uploaded photos and videos, and phone recordings, to heat-sensitive security cameras and wearables that monitor physiological signs, the big question is not how to collect enough data, but what we're going to do with it. 
And when you feel that way, you've got a problem to solve, which is, how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you? 
Kay, now can you see anything? (Girl: No.) Pull it so you can't even see down. (Girl: Okay.) Woman: It's completely blind now, right? 
What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places.

And as the cookie gets hotter, the water expands into steam. 
I had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill. 
Until the only things that you have left are these cells here, the output cells, the ones that send the signals to the brain, but because of all that degeneration they aren't sending any signals anymore. 
I am interested in how genes are marked by a chemical mark during embryogenesis, during the time we're in the womb of our mothers, and decide which gene will be expressed in what tissue. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Audience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate.

Our children are growing up very quickly learning to read, learning to use machinery. 
So Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks -- run the fine for a dozen weeks -- and then they say, "Okay, that's it. All done; fine." 
Ignorance and denial are on the rise. 
And then let's go up again. 
I'm sure there will be other problems that arise. 
And that Copernican revolution continues today to influence science and philosophy and technology and theology. 
So, Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of found this a bit unbelievable, really. 
So why work with swarms?

And then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world. 
In this scene, people are living in an iron lung. 
But they are ours for the taking -- simple examples of the vast under-utilized healthcare resources that, if we reclaimed and redeployed, could realize our most basic aspiration of healthcare. 
What about résumés? We did a study in which we had people apply for a job, and they could apply for a job either with a traditional paper résumé, or on LinkedIn, which is a social networking site like Facebook, but for professionals -- involves the same information as a résumé. 
CA: It's 30 years ago that TED was founded, 1984. 
It's a heartbreaking, excruciating conversation. 
And just put radially they're going out that way.

Josh Rushing: The night they showed the POWs and the dead soldiers -- Al Jazeera showed them -- it was powerful, because America doesn't show those kinds of images. 
Well, one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion-like states such as arousal, and see if we can identify any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties. 
This, no doubt, is the reason why a million people a week are gathering in cities. 
Imagine you brought just three nodules. 
The last report I got, there were 26,000 sexual assaults that took place in the military -- 26,000. 
A pointed, piercing tube.

So when we think about child development, we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain. 
We know that this threshold exists, because we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age, even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born. 
We built our own arm at the Rehab Institute of Chicago where we've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints to get up to six motors, or six degrees of freedom.

This is a photograph of me, nine months old. 
Meanwhile, California, New York, we can say, "Oh we're enlightened" but you know, certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted, I suppose, manifestation of racially-based voting.

Without the caregiver, they wouldn't survive, so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with these mechanisms of survival. 
So what's next? 
We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen. 
And he just sat there like this. 
Through green picture frames, students highlighted what they liked about the space, such as college students, tubing down the creek. 
"What's the best way to raise children?" 
He said this project wasn't so sustainable, and it bothered those that instituted the whole package. 
We later did what we called "the summer camp experiment," for eight years in different cities that many Americans haven't even heard of. 
So, where that motivation talk ends, what it doesn't answer is, how do you build an organization that harnesses this motivational power. 
Sometimes, a bout of hiccups will go on and on, and we try home remedies: sipping continuously from a glass of cold water, holding one's breath, a mouthful of honey or peanut butter, breathing into a paper bag, or being suddenly frightened. 
Our man was early, and he was waiting for me in front of a unit secured with four padlocks down the side. 
There are also things, quite uncanny, which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book. 
Energy is always a moral issue. 
And it can record this data for up to two years, and keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time, float to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue, to satellite, which relays it directly to our computers, and we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have -- we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks. 
That's the order of the day here. 
But the thing that fascinated me the most was phone technology. 
In the planning phase, we take everyone into a room -- teachers, teacher unions, parent associations, government officials, NGOs, everyone -- so that the reform and the solution we come up with are shared by everyone and supported by everyone. 
Why has it accelerated lately? 
And then it occurred to me, perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do. 
And there's really only one operational aircraft in the world today that's a vertical-takeoff aircraft -- as distinct from a helicopter -- and that's the Hawker Harrier jump jet. 
And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges -- a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost; some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that. 
Her friend says, "Buy it already." 
And then the cellular repair processes kick in, and then we convince those repair processes to make the edit that we want, and not a natural edit. 
And to be frank, when you get a good story, you like to keep the glory to yourself. 
(Laughter) And it also has an observational bias, because it only looks at geniuses and doesn't look at ordinary scientists and doesn't look at all of us and ask, is it really true that creativity vanishes as we age? 
So, we made a section of the mammary gland of the mouse, and all those lovely acini are there, every one of those with the red around them are an acinus, and we said okay, we are going to try and make this, and I said, maybe that red stuff around the acinus that people think there's just a structural scaffold, maybe it has information, maybe it tells the cells what to do, maybe it tells the nucleus what to do. 
That's the image: African countries. But let me say this: if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London -- if the other people who had taken money, estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this, what is that?

I've become uncomfortable when I'm separated from my laptop. 
And you know what? They were right. 
The rest of it's taken up with "take your elbows off the table" and "pass the ketchup." 
We might have come to this conference from very, very different stations in life, but believe me, we all share one incredibly powerful thing. 
Our purpose is to make the author look good. 
(Applause) And now, what the world really needs is for you to help me and our partners take some of what we have learned in Namibia to other places with similar problems: places like Mongolia, or even in your own backyards, the Northern Great Plains, where buffalo and other animals have suffered and many communities are in decline. 
And this is his chair with claw, and the poor little chair has lost its ball and it's trying to get it back before anybody notices.

Objectively, they're working well over 99 percent of the time. 
And that's what the Social Progress Index does: It reframes the debate about development, not just about GDP alone, but inclusive, sustainable growth that brings real improvements in people's lives. 
This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly. 
But city, state and regional flags are another story. 
The new information was not contained in your statement itself, but in telling it to everyone simultaneously.

Age 10, it was saving my school dinner money change. 
You get the idea: DNA can store a ton of information in a minuscule space. 
I'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others. 
So, the technology I want to talk about is for the third world, for the developing world, but it has, I think, much broader application, because information is so important in the health care system.

These judgments are consistent with the philosophical principle of utilitarianism which argues that the morally correct decision is the one that maximizes well-being for the greatest number of people. 
But the setup is pretty big. 
And it's not a human. 
Do you feel that's starting to change?" 
So the first is, it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone -- anyone who has a mobile phone -- essentially into an ATM machine. 
Let's take the biggest issue of all: family dinner. 
Now, conventional wisdom says, "Well, hey, our intellectual property belongs to us, and if someone tries to infringe it, we're going to get out our lawyers and we're going to sue them." 
We're looking at attacking energy, environment, nanotechnology -- and I'll talk about those more in a moment.

Cancun is famous for spring break, tequila and foam parties. 
And we saw about 35 alternations between open water and ice-covered water, between gravels and these plant sediments. 
The average brain has over a hundred trillion synapses, which is fantastic; we've got a lot to work with. 
It needs to decide is this person's behavior typical or is it out of the ordinary? 
It's the issue of epistemology, the study of how do we know that something is true." 
WK: I think it will produce more than 20 the watts. 
However, there are 6.3 million people worldwide who have the disease, and they have to live with incurable weakness, tremor, rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease, so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.

Let's zoom in and look at one of the favorite exoplanets. 
For, in truth, we had moved light years from the passions that animated them. 
Well, several companies around the world are working on making this same technology accessible to everyday people like the pig farmer, like you. 
Stories tell us what societies value, they offer us lessons, and they share and preserve our history. 
These are pigeons in Rotterdam. 
That means that it is the numbers that control the form, not me. 
But I saw grinding poverty. 
And, of course, at Kleiner we, kind of, apologize and say the second best way is to finance it. 
But last night, when you played that piece, he was the one I was thinking about. 
So I'm convinced that we're standing on the verge of a renaissance of phage therapy. 
He's increasingly calling the shots. 
And we're good at intriguing people by doing strange little things that help create conversations and thought. 
Here's a great idea to spread: End polio now.

we can do this. 
And he called this part of the course the X Factor, the potential of the human will. 
And we're trying to not fall in the water. 
This was the largest acquisition in their history, they'd never made an acquisition over a billion, and people asked, "How did you know this?" 
But still, the moment comes, and you take strength from whatever you believe and whatever you do. 
Gojek is worth 10 billion dollars. 
And don't just find another technologist friend; find somebody different than you. 
And this sense of being transported is one reason that we have glamour styling. 
I was proud to be part of that work, and it changed the laws and it put millions of dollars into local communities. 
Yes, it was scary, but it was also fantastic. 
And it gets quiet. 
So, what if the solution to our traffic challenges was inside us? 
Second is mix. 
(Laughter) So to bring on more codevelopers, what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs, we explained how they worked, and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems. 
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, [very] strong for our well being.

They also then set up guard houses to keep outsiders out. 
But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie, the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it back where it came from, and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing. 
And you can see the red dots, in this particular patient's case, were finger sticks, which would have missed both ends. 
So before, it used to be that you had to take an airplane out of service for one to two months, spend tens of thousands of man hours and several million dollars to try to change something. 
Not many people check boxes. 
And this is a big problem, particularly in HIV patients. 
And there is an emerging case that maybe that was what happened last July when the oil prices were so high. 
For me, the hobbies that I have are really just new work projects that I've launched. 
I had brain surgery 18 years ago, and since that time, brain science has become a personal passion of mine. 
Both are fairly bad for your health. (Laughter) If you look at it as a brand in those ways, what you'll come to realize is, it's a pretty flawed product.

And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome." 
We'll start with a dead body. 
I watched them for about an hour, and after that I was smiling. 
All due to mutant genes. 
You saw a woman who was more clear than a pool of water in a mountain stream. 
If you really want to judge people accurately, you have to get to the moment every consultant in the room is waiting for, and draw a two-by-two. 
I develop and test models of the Big Bang, using observational data. 
We decided -- we chose -- to do what it took to find our way, turning towards each of those sleepy hedgehogs, those difficult hurt feelings, with kindness and compassion and setting them free so that we could find our way back to the connection that mattered for our relationship. 
I will lend books to people, but of course, the rule is "Don't do that unless you never intend to see that book again."

Another moon that we're looking at is Titan. 
It's a very dark place to find yourself because in a sense, you have vanished. 
So it seems there are already fine particles that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere, about 100 kilometers up, that already have this effect. 
Yes, the foundation employees had angst about that. 
(Laughter) Hello. 
I was young then. 
It was an amazing experience for me. 
I was certainly not thinking, hey, I got new work here. 
Later that day, a beekeeper told reporters that her bee yard looked like it had been nuked. 
Marge is 104. 
Like, from the point of view of people who just read Twitter, that's not an issue, but for the people who actually create it, everyone's out there saying, "You know, I wish I had a few more 'likes,' followers, retweets." 
And since then, I haven't traveled to any other countries, because I'm afraid I'll be detained and deported from those countries as well. 
Their pain receptors, called nociceptors, trigger in response, cueing the brain to release a flood of neuropeptides that inflame the cranial blood vessels, swelling and heating up the head. 
The bathrooms and kitchens will, of course, have no windows. 
What do they need to know? 
If you see fireflies in North America, like so many North American sorts of things, they tend to be independent operators. They ignore each other. 
Another reason we're told not to worry is that these machines can't help but share our values because they will be literally extensions of ourselves. 
They become more craving for cocaine. 
(To audience) Thank you, guys. 
That's when I met Mohammed, in January 2007. 
It was a few months after my mother had deserted me, walked out and left me in the family home. 
We are very sensitive to the negative, but it is in part offset by the fact that we have a positivity. 
That happens in the building industry as well. 
100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon. 
When it flickers and dies, you know that exactly 45 seconds have passed, and the electric fence is dead. 
And without democracy, our societies will be nastier, our future bleak and our great, new technologies wasted. 
And then there are very fine things. 
So my bike was stolen while I was riding it -- (Laughter) which is possible if you're riding slowly enough, which I was. 
Trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow with the feathered end forward. It was a tough job, and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature. 
I mean you probably saw these headlines. This is Catherine Casey who is the first boomer to actually get Social Security. 
And they immediately said to me, "Well you are describing a classic ritual." 
And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way, over and over again. 
She was diagnosed with a grapefruit-sized fibroid. 
You can't deal with the economic and financial problem. 
A similar effect happens with random sequences of sound. 
And I think those are kind of foundational, and I think any company needs to respect that. 
They carried me around and put me on the table, and put the knife between my legs.

No limitations. 
They're serious about getting back to their biking history. 
And I think it's particularly painful for us now in the West in the grips of what I sometimes think of as a Control-Z culture -- Control-Z like the computer command, undo. 
And you can power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet with 73,000 to 145,000 five-megawatt wind turbines. 
We started in caves, then moved to clans and tribes, then villages and towns, and now we're all global citizens. 
(Applause) So those are a couple of the really cool things that Romo can do today. 
And it has a long history of being connected to space through observations of the stars. 
Here's a monkey-eye-view. Monkeys are shorter, so it's a little short. 
What Galois realized: it isn't just the individual symmetries, but how they interact with each other which really characterizes the symmetry of an object. 
And the corollary, of course, is that any further changes that could significantly change the substrate of thinking could have potentially enormous consequences. 
But I heard that you were leaving, and I had to come and tell you you've been an incredibly important person in my life. 
Their names will be engraved on the markers that hang above us. 
Two hundred thousand. 
Those are my hands. I get up at 4 a.m. 
Now, I've been mentioning children, but SUDEP peaks, actually, among people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, and the next line I'm going to put up is probably going to make some people uncomfortable, but it's less uncomfortable than we'll all be if this list is extended to somebody you know. 
Basically I'd work with different architects. 
They were part of a community, just for an instant, and it made them happy. 
I believe we're living in a golden era of entrepreneurship.

But the gay marriage movement has been making gains for years now. 
I left the ring but Gator stayed with me, and I use the turned-up version of myself every day. 
Full-field-of-view vision that can be sharp at any desired distance. 
But if there's one thing I've learned from my work as a doula, it's that a little bit of unconditional support can go a really long way. 
If somebody steals a joke from Larry David, for instance, it's not as funny. 
But look how this has changed: As I go forward, what has changed, the world population has grown, and the humps start to merge. 
The thing that's great is that we get together yearly and talk about, okay, do you hire staff, what do you give to them? 
We can reconcile. 
Well, neuroscientists tell us that about a third of the brain's cortex is engaged in vision. 
And then it occurred to me, of course, that none of my child sponsorships, none of the microloans, none of the traditional anti-poverty programs were going to stop Brutus, because they weren't meant to. 
More hemp houses -- it's a theme in Japan, apparently. 
There are more things that I think that I want to do. 
And having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland, I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder -- thank God for technology -- to interview people, thinking that if I walked in their words -- which is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform -- if I walked in their words, that I could sort of absorb America. 
(Laughter) That wouldn't be such a good incentive for me." 
And what makes octopus intelligence so amazing is that it comes from a biological structure completely different from ours.

We were no longer allowed on deck. 
Fantastic chap. 
It is a completely different notion. 
So, like a crazy person, I decided to quit my job and focus entirely on this project. 
The importance of coming to grips with values like justice, equity, truth, becomes increasingly evident as students discover that interest alone cannot tell them what they need to know when the issue is rethinking education, our approach to health, or strategies for achieving an economics of equity. 
So we changed the way we ran our innovation and planning meetings in two important ways. 
But she's in constant pain.

If it was a homing pigeon, it would be called "Homer's Odyssey." 
And we were drinking a few beers, and like scientists do, he told me about his work. 
I decided to stake my life on it. 
So the point is thinking it and then doing it. 
Opportunity is the gift within every gift, and we have this saying, opportunity knocks only once. 
I'm Italian. In Italy, design is normal. 
Such a fine, sunny day, and I have to go, but what does my death matter, if through us, thousands of people are awakened and stirred to action?”

In fact, Jonas and his tumor were as different from each other as you and the person sitting next to you. 
And Prego turned to Howard, and they said, "You're telling me that one third of Americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs?" 
We're excited to have you with us.

We don't have to fall in love with each other, but we can become friends. 
But this problem should seem pretty familiar to all of you because I'm pretty sure you've seen it somewhere else. 
And we need to rethink our development strategies, so that we're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers, but rather to stop being poor farmers. 
So I was kind of proud of it, and I went to a friend of mine, and said, "You know, this is, you know, kind of the best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on. 
As news swept through the village, the symptoms appeared to spread. 
And because poisons are not the best thing for survival, our bodies evolved a direct but unpleasant way to get rid of what we ate that was causing the confusion. 
(Laughter) But in surviving this last year, I was reminded of a cardinal rule -- not a research rule, but a moral imperative from my upbringing -- "you've got to dance with the one who brung ya". 
6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people, all different colors, shapes, sizes.

(Laughter) Did you see Lenny's face? 
These are photographs of things a person touched during 24 hours. 
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society. 
We were going to do things better. 
So we know that our beliefs and expectations can be manipulated, which is why we do trials where we control against a placebo, where one half of the people get the real treatment, and the other half get placebo. 
Absolutely it's making a difference. 
I mean, do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here? 
This is a scene from Star Wars where the 3PO comes out and he sees machines making machines. How depraved!

And I don't want to start whistling "Look for the Union Label," and all that happy-worker crap. 
(Laughter) They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers, looking at them just once. 
And there's the very important thing there: If you want to survive the cold, you ought to be suspended. Right? 
I don't know. Maybe they think that, uh, killers don't plan ahead? 
Luckily for you, there’s a half-finished experimental teleportation robot that may be able to get you all home, if you can figure out how to work through the quirks of its design. 
Wait, does that mean that they're actually a man or actually a woman?" 
Professor Patricia Devine of the University of Wisconsin has shown us how we can attack our hidden biases head on and effectively reduce them. 
Though the common ancestor of all modern birds could fly, many different bird species have independently lost their flight. 
As I started to get to know this mysterious person who was my kid, my fixed, tight story of tragedy loosened. 
So I've found that if you're a theater person, you have outdoor street theater festivals. 
A weak human player plus a machine plus a better process is superior to a very powerful machine alone, but more remarkably, is superior to a strong human player plus machine and an inferior process. 
Am I scaring you yet? 
It's been estimated that a single ton of soil -- fertile soil -- contains approximately four million species of bacteria, all unknown. 
So we came up with this people's platform, and don't worry, I'm not going to read the whole thing to you out loud -- if you're interested, you can read it at theleap.org. 
Because actually, never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry. This actually had symbolic value, badge value. 
I had mostly Euro-Americans, you know, with me from Washington, DC. 
And if I could summarize that all up into one single sketch it would be this. 
We wanted to create an object that could capture the subjective data around mood swings that's so essential to diagnosis.

They even promised to reinvest 20 percent of any profits into local education programs. 
The byproduct of this is what we value. 
So the game is about self-expression, creativity, not just overcoming the challenges posed by the simulation. 
We’re doing the same thing as designers. 
And it also matters who the people are who are voting. 
Similarly, by driving the deer out of some places and the vegetation recovering on the valley sides, there was less soil erosion, because the vegetation stabilized that as well. 
Of course, you could do this for all the airports around the world. 
The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor. 
It represents the change in a reliable way of the responses of tens of millions, possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain. 
But very soon after, there was a man who took the scissors and cut my clothes, and then they took the thorns of the rose and stuck them in my stomach.

It doesn't sound anything like "Wavin' Flag" to me. 
When she once again lifted the lid and peered in, a warm beam of light rose out and fluttered away. 
What do I say now? 
But it was amazing to see that he was also executed on March 29, 1984. 
What you're going to see -- we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system -- these are the paths of Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10, the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system. 
In 1900, 40 percent of all US employment was on farms. 
Now that expense can be huge, but if the town can mobilize X amount of volunteers for Y hours, the dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town's contribution.

It was built in the jungles of South America. 
So these robots are related to unmanned aerial vehicles. 
It's the shift between thinking of yourself as a thing which has all the experiences of life, and thinking of yourself as simply that collection of all experiences in life. 
So people really do believe that you can do well by doing good. 
Since the 2015 megatransect, we have explored all major rivers of the Okavango River basin, covering a life-changing 4,000 miles of detailed research transects on our dugout canoes and our fat-tire mountain bikes. 
They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years, which is a really long time in the life of a bird. 
So then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do, and depending on the conditions, we have some protocells on the left that are moving around and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment. 
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war. 
(Laughter) Work on it. Work on it. 
One man, one man with one charismatic voice, started this whole thing. 
Let's look at a couple of quick examples. 
Nine hours later, Paul died. 
I met her two years ago. 
And it got big enough to the point where there was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, and Rick Astley pops out, and rickrolls millions of people on television. 
It's actually really emotional work. 
This is true off the playing field as well. 
So we all have in our head the perfect house, the American dream, which is a house, the dream house. 
But because your brains are not trained in the art of deception, the solutions you come up with will, 99 percent of the time, be way off the mark. 
If the person took the photo solely with the intention of sharing it, there was no increase in enjoyment, because they didn't do it for themselves. 
And you know why they agreed? 
This is sort of a continuation of some of the earlier work, and we just got our first seed money today towards that, so it's our first project. 
If you're a patient that needs an operation and there isn't a surgeon available, you're left with some really difficult choices: to wait, to travel, or not to have an operation at all. 
So now I'm talking to all of the businesspeople and entrepreneurs. 
And I was dragging all the food I needed, the supplies, the equipment, sleeping bag, one change of underwear -- everything I needed for nearly three months. 
And so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits, we are going to collect only the data. 
There were six men on the bus, young men who you might encounter every day in India, and the chilling account of what followed was played over and over again in the Indian and international media. 
For example, if the cohort in our herbal study consisted of people who took the supplement for health reasons, they may have already had higher rates of nausea than the other people in the sample. 
And I was sitting there and saying, "This is where my tax dollars are wasted -- (Laughter) on this kind of soft science."

If you do, be genuine. Be honest, up-front. 
CA: So that's the key thing?

For some metabolites, we can measure their molecular mass using mass spectrometry instruments. 
10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two ... 
Below that, they said, the human body would implode. 
When we returned, 10 years later, this is what we saw. 
But scuba diving, submersibles and all the work that we're setting about to do here will help rectify that. 
(Laughter) But if you think about it, the front page of the newspaper is usually bad news, and cues man's failures. 
We moved our gravity center from Madrid and the house of the concrete beams to Brookline. 
Then I turn around ... 
And we're looking for the dimmings caused by stars blocking off some of that light. 
They were already drowning in manure. (Laughter) So 1860, they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of New York. 
And so then these people go on, they rise up through business and government, they take leadership positions. 
And what would happen if we removed that secrecy? 
But however cheap they would have been to make in volume it turned out that it was going to cost close to 200 million dollars to design and build the first one. 
SP: I want to tell you about some of the incredible things that happened as a result of your discoveries. 
It was so hard find her that I hired a private investigator and he found her. 
And your sensation's the exact opposite.

And this isn't just a problem in Britain. 
PP: I don't know. 
Never can you doubt that we are all in this together. 
But today I want to focus on just one finding -- perhaps the most important discovery to come from this remarkable study. 
And the good news, this one's a monster. 
I was seeing myself not from my perspective, but vividly and continuously from the perspective of other people's responses to me. 
They want to read away their fines, they need to be literate. 
I don't hide anything from them.

One fact is not true. 
I sometimes wonder. 
And it's extraordinary how far belief can take you. 
Whereas a self-driving system can look at that pedestrian and say, I don't know what they're about to do, slow down, take a better look, and then react appropriately after that. 
We've had people pretend that this is a problem that's been fixed. 
Not all civil society organizations are good. 
BF: Incredible, you say? 
The number 415/11 was my new identity, and I soon learned that was the case with the other women who we were sharing this space with. 
And so, the problem is that it's not just one system, it's multiple systems on multiple scales. 
This is also out there, you know. 
And third, when we do cut, we need to save the legacies, the mother trees and networks, and the wood, the genes, so they can pass their wisdom onto the next generation of trees so they can withstand the future stresses coming down the road. 
Now it turned out to be Bill Gates' doodle. 
What does that mean? 
The longest longitudinal study of humans ever conducted is called the Harvard Grant Study. 
Satellites there are naturally buffeted by Earth's atmosphere, so their orbits naturally decay, and they'll eventually burn up, probably within a couple of decades. 
And this guy's on display downstairs, so take a look if you get a chance. 
But many African kingdoms and the Islamic world were flourishing, and Mansa Musa played a great role in bringing the fruits of this flourishing to his own realm. 
But news of this victory traveled unreliably. 
Now, this is really important. 
But for the majority of the human race, millions of years of evolution have fine-tuned the immune system so that it works for, rather than against us. 
Compare them to the tools our ancestors used; they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's. 
A bit more challenging, right? (Laughter) Yellow or blue? Blue. We have some people that are serious out there. Yeah. (Laughter) Good. So in the same way that we actually see the effects of video games on people's behavior, we can use brain imaging and look at the impact of video games on the brain, and we do find many changes, but the main changes are actually to the brain networks that control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex which is very well known to control the orientation of attention. 
But also, because he was an inveterate hacker, he left a tiny digital wormhole through which he alone could crawl.
