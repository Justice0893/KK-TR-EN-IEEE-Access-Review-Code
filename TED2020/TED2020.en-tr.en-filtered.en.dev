And I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it. 
700 people that way -- but it's great and really it's just -- ES: So Cohh, what is going on in chat right now?

All the information in the world won't be very useful unless you know how to read the news. 
Not coming in with our own notions, because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end. 
Our ancestors were short, hairy apes. 
There is no parking spot available in the area, but how would he know? 
But each one of these is a different age, and if we can find out how old they are and then we can measure those chemical signals, this helps us to find out what's been going on in the ocean in the past. 
Now 67 is the new highest possible average, so no reasonable guess should be higher than ⅔ of that, which is 44. 
To fight boredom and amuse himself while in the CMU, McGowan had been spreading a rumor that I was secretly the president of a Twilight fan club in Washington, DC (Laughter) For the record, I'm not.

Because according to this, getting something wrong means there's something wrong with us. 
And they can actually often be smarter than even the smartest person within them. 
Can you explain at all what that work was?

We pay for it in our taxes on April 15th. 
And these red dots show the most congested parts, which are the bridges that lead into the inner city.

Up to this point, all transfusions had occurred in real time, directly between two individuals. 
(Laughter) I eventually did figure it out. 
Because I also, I'm going to admit to you, I also thought, "How can I be like a hot-shot young full professor who teaches human rights and not know this? 
He was the son of one of the poorest families in the village. 
Probably some variation of, "Tell me about a time when," right? 
All these technological devices are only mastery of the universe out there, not the one in here. 
Maybe you dreamed of traveling to every continent. 
Will we use these choices to make a society that is better, that is more successful, that is kinder? 
It certainly says far more about real freedoms than Magna Carta. 
CA: So the country is already seeing effects now. 
My left lung had collapsed when I was born. 
In the face of so much hatred and ignorance against those in the Middle East, every moment on site felt like a protest for peace. 
These stereotypes and biases have real-world consequences, both subtle and very important. 
Roman reinforcements were returning from the Pontic wars, and the rebels’ ranks and spirits were broken. 
Every Git system generates this number the same way, which means this is a signature tied directly and unforgeably to a particular change. 
Our heritage is much more than our collective memory -- it's our collective treasure. 
And that's why you don't need to model the glass. 
It's a world in which there are rewards everywhere for actions that people take. 
This is why -- (Laughs) at 81, I cannot retire. 
And here's where the string part comes in. 
And I'll start out with a puzzle, the puzzle of indirect speech acts. 
Five factorial is 120. 
You sit across from, say, your grandfather for close to an hour and you listen and you talk. 
You're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock. 
Now, there she goes, right overhead. 
(Laughter) This company raised hundreds of millions of dollars with the notion that we will deliver grocery orders online. 
Now, Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power. 
But that mood is changing, and I'm starting to see many leaders say, "Help us out." 
And the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge -- I love bridges, metaphorically and symbolically and structurally -- and it was a bit of a disappointment, because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it; it really wasn't in use. 
Now, one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body. 
CA: So here's a couple of beautiful girls from your country. 
I live in a world where there's too much CO2 in the atmosphere because of human activity. 
Three, build your idea, piece by piece, out of concepts that your audience already understands. 
The problem is, Sorona costs about 400 million dollars and took seven years to build. 
The good news is, this is possible, almost. 
You're mad. I'll drive. I know I can drive." 
A respected writer called to stage his own intervention after reading a few early chapters, and he began, much like my mother, "Hey, listen. 
It is the strategic high ground of space. 
It accepts algae and detritus in one end, and through this beautiful, glamorous set of stomach organs, out the other end comes cleaner water. 
We need to encourage, even on a local and national level, more movement, more participation, more interaction with people who we don't know and whose views we might not necessarily agree with. 
Two are facing down: one marked with a four, and one with a seven. 
What is it really like to be a young woman in India? 
When the telegraph came along, it was clear that it was going to globalize the news industry. 
Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape, we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the "noble savage," which is an idea racist in its simplicity, or alternatively, we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are. 
Let me illustrate that. 
What we hope is that there are some signs of improvement from this treatment. 
Recently, I was dining at an outdoor cafe, and the server came up to our table, and asked us if we had dined there before, and I said, "Yes, yes, we have." 
But I didn't let that daunt me. 
it's that the Gala sausage roll is a product that's made by a global company called UAC foods that's active throughout Africa and the Middle East, but the Gala sausage roll is not sold in stores. 
So we drop in the water and go over the edge of this cliff, and then we start dropping, dropping, dropping. 
And she goes, "Well, I see Jesus," and started crying and left. 
And then the third thing would be, please show me a sheaf of texts written by 16-year-old girls, because I would want to know where this language had developed since our times, and ideally I would then send them back to you and me now so we could examine this linguistic miracle happening right under our noses. 
And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation, I have to admit, Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying, "But who's going to volunteer for this procedure?" 
She was trusting in a protocol that even if complied with, wouldn't necessarily save her son. 
And into that vacuum grow these violent, intolerant forces. 
But the idea is to force the air to go in the effective part of the plants. 
The next most consumed seafood in America, and also throughout the West, is tuna. 
What would be the perfect timeline that might include something later, would be time well spent for you here at TED in your last day here? 
But while none of Hypatia’s own writings survive, her contemporaries’ and students’ accounts of her work and life paint a picture of the qualities that made her renowned as a scholar, beloved as a teacher, and ultimately led to her downfall. 
They get building material for houses, a contract for selling the sugar, so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally. 
As I speak, there are construction crews preparing Otodo Gbame's beaches for anyone who can afford a multi-million-dollar view. 
And so I do like something which is pointed, not blunt, something which is focused on reality, something that has the power, through its leverage, to transform even a very small space. 
I'm cutting my hair, it's getting short and long, because every time I saw Kofi Annan, I was so worried that he thought I was a hippie that I cut it, and that was kind of what was going on. 
So this is just like a crossword puzzle, except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it. 
And yet, what's the point of having such decorative nether regions? 
This keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go. 
Once the components arrive at the assembly line, they undergo cutting, pouring, melting, baking, cooling, and gluing, before the final products can be stitched together. 
(Laughter) But joking aside, I think our world is full of unprecedented challenges, and this comes with an emotional backlash, because in the face of high-speed change, many people wish to slow down, and when there's too much unfamiliarity, people long for the familiar. 
It's off in the future. It's weak. 
So people can come and really experience this and also look out all around the area, and use that height that we have to have for its function. 
So this is where we get to Yochai's discussion. 
Now, I don't say that is necessarily a bad thing; I just think that this example points us to a general realization, and that is: no matter what technology or design you look at, even something we consider as well-intended and as good in its effects as Stutzman's Freedom, comes with certain values embedded in it. 
It's wired into us. 
I had just driven home, it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter, I had been visiting my friend, Jeff, across town, and the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees -- and don't bother asking if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit, minus 40 is where the two scales meet -- it was very cold. 
In your career and personal life, in your relationships, and in your heart and soul, your backwards-swimming fish do you great harm.

And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance? 
Will it happen again? 
And then, 15 years after looking at Linux and figuring out how the community worked, he said, "I think I know how to write a version control system for free people." 
All of Napoleon's troops were fed with silver utensils, Napoleon himself with gold utensils. 
And there's basically nobody there anymore, a few people trying to keep using it.

After five months, we applied again, but this time I didn't go alone. 
MO: I was here in Boston. 
I'll never do it again." 
We cannot deny it -- presence creates possibility. 
So this nature, this kind of wild, untended part of our urban, peri-urban, suburban agricultural existence that flies under the radar, it's arguably more wild than a national park, because national parks are very carefully managed in the 21st century. 
But back to animals and junk food. 
However, in this reality, our design was being challenged that it looks so different from the surroundings. 
We're not trying to find ourselves at an employer's expense. 
So to get this image on the left by Anita Kunz, or the one on right by Tomer Hanuka, you have to play spot the differences. 
Instead, they want to take the shortcut, and that shortcut is self-reinforcing. 
And the test is: one, will it do the job? 
Whereas bad relationships, by which I mean, probably going to get divorced, they found themselves getting into a spiral of negativity. 
Second, diplomacy. 
I believe also, our generation, our relationship to satisfying what we want is far less tangible than any other previous generation. 
You cannot know when and how, but it's worth trying. 
But then she was beheaded, so never mind her as a role model. 
So go outside a lot and look up. 
That was it. 
Not only were our lives not celebrated, but our struggles have been forgotten and, yeah, to some people, that makes trans issues seem new. 
The bell had rung, and I was seated at my desk, when one of my students, who is deaf, approached me and said that he’d like to join the military. 
The mother who is a sensitive type will go gooey over her son the poet. 
What would it take for a truly inclusive digital currency to take hold here? 
And I think it inspires a tough question: What's our goal with entrepreneurship? 
And what can we do together to improve my health where it begins? 
Inmates are highly adaptive. 
So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen. 
So when Beethoven gets his new Érard piano, he's writing his third piano concerto, he goes and he gives a concert, and he and uses all those extra notes. 
Was the Big Bang just an accident? 
I attended the town hall march when students held up signs saying "Kill them, hang them." 
And we started, and for the next 53 hours, it was an intense, unforgettable life experience. 
To find out, I've been studying people that I come to call "originals." 
(Applause) See, I have a legacy in South Central. 
But it makes for good theater, and it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week. 
Twelve years later, 2006, I learned that Bobby Wilcher had dropped all of his appeals, and his execution date was approaching. 
So we started focusing on processing issues. 
Singing is sharing. 
And so we need to be able to do the same thing. 
25 years. 
A Congolese woman, who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them, and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling killed in front of them, how they're doing okay right now. 
But because of the modular targeting system, we can actually put it exactly where we want it. 
Okay? So you can see a list of wireless networks. 
And right next to where I used to work, there was a slum. 
From there I started with skydiving. 
Now, society hasn't advanced all that much. 
"Well, he threatened everybody with cutlery. 
And things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced. 
This is a photograph taken about 100 years ago of my grandfather and great-grandfather. 
I love it because each day I decide, sometimes gamely, and sometimes against the moment's reason, to cleave to the reasons for living. 
So what do birth certificates have to do with international development? 
And it was set in a wider watery ooze. 
And the way to do that is to understand where trust wobbles for ourselves and have a ready-made prescription to overcome it. 
(Laughter) So what I decided to do was trick the Facebook algorithm into feeding me more news that I didn't necessarily agree with, and this worked fine for a while, but it wasn't enough, because my online footprint already established the patterns that I like to hear. 
A lot of these people are highly educated and skilled workers. 
Oh, that's going to be a disaster waiting to happen. 
Another reason -- although I think, perhaps, the most powerful reason -- why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we've erected against slowing down. 
Or they're worried that their abuser is going to escalate to violence or perhaps even greater violence than they've already been engaging in. 
But she was sick with worry: She worried her son would be abducted and taken off to be a child soldier, she worried her daughters would be raped, she worried for their lives. 
"Check the box below if you want to participate in the organ donor program." 
And even when we don’t, it can be challenging to correctly identify what’s held dear by people who don’t already agree with us. 
I don't smoke cigarillos anymore. 
And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks. 
This got my curious about what makes us unique as Hawaiians -- namely, our genetic makeup.

Every neuron is different. 
For two years, I volunteered on an ambulance in Jerusalem. 
We're not all of them, of course, but TED is a community of opinion leaders. 
So, this is mine. 
(Laughter) It's a challenge, so pay attention, please. 
And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new. 
My relationship with God -- it was not love at first sight. 
At any time, one or both of them might lie, though they also might tell the truth. 
The whole world is laid out for you, the best jobs are laid out for you, and you want to go and work in a village? 
Well, why did I spend a decade doing other stuff for the poor? 
When my little kids -- when my kids were little -- they're all grown now, I have grandkids -- I used to go in and sit on the side of their bed, and I used to watch my kids sleep. 
Who are you to guide them and who are you to show them what is right, what is wrong, what these people have to say?"

This is "Sleep," the Virtual Choir. 
Dopamine is associated with romantic love.

A lot of young girls look up to me. 
That last beep was Jesse Owens. 
And so, he's the modern Lucifer effect, a man of God who becomes the Angel of Death.

This is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley. 
There are 19 species of mammal that live longer than expected, given their body size, than man, and 18 of those are bats. 
He's looking at his table; he's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years, (Laughter) and he wants it to be perfect. 
(Laughter) Seeing Lauran's sons at the march and holding signs took it to a new level for me, and not in a good way, because I know these boys, I love these boys, and I didn't feel they were old enough to understand what the march stood for. 
With thorium, we could do the same thing with 7,000 tons of thorium that could be mined at a single site. 
But interestingly, it's also a view increasingly being heard reinforced by neuroscience. 
Diamonds -- I'll start with ace of diamonds. 
What you are doing is dangerous and will break the social fabric of our society." 
Instead of taking a single, high quality image, we could take a videostream of individually noisier frames, but then we could recombine all of those frames together into very high-quality images using sophisticated pixel processing techniques here on the ground, at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system. 
I think the ancient Greeks said it best when they said, "Know thyself." 
So even with partial subsidy, three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net, and now you only have 20 percent of the people with the bed nets, you lose the health immunity, that's not great. 
That is who they were. 
And hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin. 
Vaccines were promised to developing countries. 
But there is not a day that goes by where I am not so grateful to be married to this man; where I'm not so grateful for the possibility of changing minds, and rewarding conversations, and creating a world where love belongs to us all. 
That was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there that we do not pay for at the pump. 
Describe the values of your fellow citizens that you activated, and the sense of moral purpose that you were able to stir. 
So a flight from conversation can really matter because it can compromise our capacity for self-reflection. 
Do you know, of the 1.3 billion Chinese, over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race, the Han? 
Now, as I looked at this from an engineering perspective, it became very clear to me that what I needed to architect was a smart, collaborative, socially intelligent artificial intelligence. 
The rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy. 
We need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies. 
It's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive, and they go home and can't do it. 
Go to the main floor, you see these light bulbs. 
And so while my colleagues were building these cathedrals great and tall and buying property outside of the city and moving their congregations out so that they could create or recreate their cities of God, the social structures in the inner cities were sagging under the weight of all of this violence. 
This is what's really cool: it's aging more slowly. 
So you need the best ideas to address them. 
On a psychological level, we lie partly to paint a better picture of ourselves, connecting our fantasies to the person we wish we were rather than the person we are. 
And he saved my father. 
The church he sometimes goes to has its creed decided in meetings in Ghana. 
So some of you may be thinking, "Gosh, that's hyperbole. 
In fact, if you look really closely at stuff, if you look at the basic substructure of matter, there isn't anything there. 
I want to find out what you think. 
Last month, I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation something called the $10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize. 
And so in my search for an architecture of the borderlands, I began to wonder, is the wall architecture? 
I show you the Parkes Radio Telescope, affectionately known as "The Dish." 
(Applause) But I also know that I would never do the horseback-riding part again. 
And in fact, I took a look, and Banff National Park is doing all of the things I just listed: suppressing fire, having fire, radio-collaring wolves, reintroducing bison. 
A meme is not equivalent to an idea. 
But there are some forms of cancer that don't respond to these approaches, and the tumor survives or comes back, even after an onslaught of drugs. 
Imagine a coil. For those of you that are engineers, there's a capacitor attached to it too. 
And we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull, and flip the market. 
There is a company called Sharklet Technologies that's now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals to keep bacteria from landing, which is better than dousing it with anti-bacterials or harsh cleansers that many, many organisms are now becoming drug resistant. 
And yet, Filipe is one of over 300,000 students that benefited from the media center solution and got access to postprimary education. 
The day I was with Sister Stephen, I needed to take her away from Villa Loretto to film part of her story. 
Licinia could be accused of incestum, meaning unchastity, at any time and be sacrificed whether she's innocent or guilty. 
Now, far be it from me to argue with the magical powers of caffeine, but I don't think reducing tension is one of them. 
So that's the part that is modular in the system; everything else stays the same. 
And despite all this, as my daughter loves to say, everything is not rainbows and unicorns in cohousing, and I'm not best friends with every single person in my community. 
We put a call out there, and to my surprise, in a couple of months, we had hundreds of entries from around the world. 
I confused true jihad with this perversion as presented by the fascist Islamists -- these people who use the idea of jihad to justify their lust for power, authority and control on earth: a perversion perpetuated today by fascist Islamist groups like al-Qaeda, Islamic State and others. 
This is what I've been doing, because I think it's the most fun thing in the world. 
The heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it, and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles. 
Yet for me, signing it with my thumb sticking up like that doesn't feel natural. 
You want to know how obsessed I am. This project's only for me, and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay a 1941 Chinese San Francisco-based newspaper, in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ... 
But it does make you wonder what else we've missed. 
So, they believed that knowledge came from authorities that actually knew very little. 
What do you do? 
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches. 
So is that a good thing? 
So you can bump things -- they're all physically, you know, manipulable and stuff. 
And she looks at me and she goes, "Dad, after what you just did, how can you call anything impossible?" 
I think the good news for me would be if we could go back and talk about the unleashing, the continuation of the unleashing of human potential. 
So, should we rather ask, "Can anything save newspapers?" 
(Laughter) And I sort of really was dumbstruck. 
Why did I say that? 
Now, let's look at it. 
Everyone can use corn juice for cars. From Fritz." 
They've connected in the most fundamental way, through the medium of storytelling. 
(Laughter) Things like, "Look, when I'm out in public and I see old people holding hands, couples who have clearly been together for decades, and then I look at them and I imagine all of the things they've been through together, the good things, the bad things, the arguments they've had over who should take out the trash ... 
Yet, while the grandeur of the ice is evident, so, too, is its vulnerability. 
One the other end of the spectra is Uber. 
Right? Or maybe the opposite. 
So there are lands few and far between on Earth itself that are hospitable to humans by any measure, but survive we have. 
Secondly, the structures that drive hair growth are called hair follicles, a network of complex organs that forms before we're born, and grows hair in an everlasting cycle. 
His manager hired a so-called efficiency engineer, who advised him to save money by using more of the film stock that he'd shot, having fewer retakes. 
And when we curb abuse, we will expand freedom. 
They're very important in oil spills. 
Now, throughout history, men practically had a license to cheat with little consequence, and supported by a host of biological and evolutionary theories that justified their need to roam, so the double standard is as old as adultery itself. 
This is the problem with Zeno's argument. 
And as far as isolation goes, when we as a species do colonize distant planets, there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way. 
So one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix. 
But today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan. 
This time, I started putting electronics, frogs, strange bottles I'd find in the street -- anything I could find -- because I was always finding things my whole life, and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects. 
Humanity moves forward when we find new ways to rely on and understand and trust each other. 
SB: Are you nervous about that? 
How do we improve the living standards of five billion people? 
You can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research. 
What did you gain, cognitively, from convincing me? 
There's this beautiful bay, lots of soft corals and stomatopods." 
You do not. 
And we've added two special molecules. 
And so -- I returned to the hotel lobby with my arms covered in blood, when one of the hotel gofers stopped me and asked me to pay the tax I hadn't paid for 10 days. 
And that is that I think that what we have in our society is, we forgot our connection with nature. 
(Laughter) And it's not only our partners who get it wrong. 
Neutron stars also have the strongest magnetic field of any known object. 
In the middle of the 19th century, with the construction of the Crystal Palace in London, glass leapt to the top of the list of quintessentially modern substances. 
But then we would talk and we would discover that actually, a car is a computer, it has a navigation system inside of it. 
I'm not a D.J., though, but I just always wanted to do that. 
These are two magnets. 
Now I will interact. So a different person all the time, so not the same person can answer. 
People figured that it would be too complex or too expensive for some hacker to build one. 
Researchers Nosek, Banaji and Greenwald have looked at data from millions of people, and what they've found is, for example, most white Americans can more quickly and easily associate white people and good things than black people and good things, and most men and women can more quickly and easily associate men and science than women and science. 
Ben Kenobi is Obi Wan Kenobi. Holy shit! So it keeps us -- (Laughter) Have you guys not seen that? 
It's something that happens to us without our consent. 
You're giving yourself a performance review, and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you professionally. 
Now let's look at another example with turbocharging performance. 
In fact, the predictive relationship between genital response and subjective experience is between 10 and 50 percent. 
Now just to orient you, each box is showing the firing patterns of several cells, and just as in the previous slides, each row is a different cell, and I just made the pulses a little bit smaller and thinner so I could show you a long stretch of data. 
And it actually -- so technologically, it works. 
Imagine, as I shake the ketchup bottle, someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me. 
So I went there and also I proposed to the priests, "Why don't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes?"

So I said, "Well, what did I expect?" 
But the way that you extend credit will change going forward, the way that you think about scoring people in terms of can they handle credit. 
We've also talked about concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
What if that Copernican insignificance was actually all wrong? 
It can be physical. 
[Under your burkini you could be hiding a sex bomb] Political cartoons are meant to provoke, just like opinions. 
We haven't invested nearly as much in the physical infrastructure to ensure that that happens. 
The folds' increased mass slows their vibrations, resulting in deeper voices.

One example would be: people fear kidnapping by strangers, when the data supports that kidnapping by relatives is much more common. 
When we spoke to activists, they told us that empowerment begins with ensuring proper gender equality, where the women's status is established in society. 
The primary goal is connecting people. 
And by the way, that's one of the reasons that I'm not interested in the debate about I.Q., about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups. 
Isn’t that what Caesar had been accused of?

CR: And that began the idea of an automated car. 
But there are two extraordinarily simple ways you can keep that from happening: soap and water, and hand sanitizer. 
SD: This is a very powerful black hole. 
And so I set out with this concept, scientifically, that artistic creativity, it's magical, but it's not magic, meaning that it's a product of the brain.

The good news is, we're working on digital nervous systems that connect us to the things we design. 
And "N" -- "neurotic individuals," in contrast to those who are more stable. 
Here's what I found: humans can hear anything if it's true.

How do they do that? 
She knows there's always going to be some part of Gator Magraw in here, and she wants our daughter and twin sons to discover themselves the way that I did, but probably with fewer body slams and steel chair shots to the head. 
Here's how the game is played: there are two players; they've never played the game before, they will not play the game again, they don't know each other, and they are, in fact, in separate rooms. 
And nobody fires Batman's brother from the Eastern Taxi Company 'cause they was making cutbacks, neither.

(Laughter) Let's move further down the torso. 
You got two choices. 
These look in order, I'm probably -- hopefully -- yeah. Three, four, five, six, seven and ...

Alright, I want to be clear that there's nothing inherently wrong with any of this modern technology. 
The ancient Athenians randomly selected citizens to fill the vast majority of their political posts. 
Nothing's been diluted. 
And we as a community, we've made computers smaller and smaller. 
(Laughter) They don’t. Their mothers don’t say to little baby fish, "Careful you don’t fall over." 
RH: Well, you know, my first company -- we were very process obsessed. 
It can cause chronic stress, or even physical injury. 
I realized you couldn't take this kind of picture with a conventional aircraft. 
So for other kinds of operations, there's definitely a need for other scaffold-based approaches. 
From slavery through mass incarceration, it always has been. 
And we said, well the first erection would take one week. 
The dot sizes are going to grow, you're going to see a sea of yellow take over.

It was here in the late '60s and early '70s that major droughts brought three million people to become dependent upon emergency food aid, with about up to 250,000 dying. 
That signal was so strong, it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water buried in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material. 
Same pattern. 
But there is a problem, and you can tell from the fact that the pharmaceutical industry isn't well-loved. 
It's my average, and I'm trying to get better little by little. 
He has to keep his job.

So now let me give you some specific examples about each of these. 
Imagine what it means for your personal security as a heavily armed civilian population gets angrier and angrier about why this was allowed to happen. 
You know, there's a popular trope out there that the reason we haven't had the transformative impact on the treatment of illness is because we don't have powerful-enough drugs, and that's partly true. 
We found, for example, that here in the New York area, you could get an echocardiogram for 200 dollars in Brooklyn or for 2,150 dollars in Manhattan, just a few miles away. 
Considering how naïve I really was at the time, I took his advice to heart. 
Each time he'd add a document, he'd move what was in there along and he'd add that document to the left-hand side of the box. 
But we don't feel that they're helping us. 
And imagine the debris that would be strewn everywhere if a collision actually happened, thousands of smaller pieces of debris becoming new obstacles. 
A little bit faster. 
Now the only problem with that definition is that it's completely wrong -- both scientifically and otherwise. 
That may be the biggest, greatest gift that the movement has given us. 
Climate change is affecting our homes, our communities, our way of life. We should be preparing at every scale and at every opportunity.

And we have ballots that are pages and pages long. 
Yeah. Thank you. 
Like I say, it's a cross between Natural History Museum and a NASA laboratory. 
We're on our way to solving -- and as I said earlier, I know we've got a long way to go -- the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it, and that's the environmental issue, but I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock. 
This is a beefalo. 
So many people die that I don't even cry no more.

And the envelope pushed back, and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while. 
Of course, there's another narrative as well, so we shouldn't get caught up on that, you know, somebody who's poor and going to face discrimination, they also might pursue a resume-building strategy. 
Now, at the beginning of this talk, I said that films -- that they can actually transport us, but I would like to argue that films, they can transform us.

Went in, paid my ten pesos, walked up -- 10 women two guys, usually a good ratio. 
So it felt this has a social dimension. 
So we're going to test the machine. 
In fact, there's a growing global community of innovators rethinking materials with biology. 
And it's not just plants. 
You need a complex laser system, a so-called femtosecond laser system, which you focus onto a very tiny spot -- very, very, very tiny -- and this is a very expensive, not very durable laser system. (Laughs) And on the other hand, you need a very complex positioning system. 
And it's kind of crazy to think about that now, because, like all great innovations, it's not long after we get access to something that we start to take it for granted.

And if you have a serious theory, you should be able to predict when Google is going to go bust. 
Flat surfaces behave one way, while positively and negatively curved surfaces display very different characteristics. 
So your task is to notice if you feel any difference as I speak. 
When we think of what is necessary for the phenomenon that we call life, we think of compartmentalization, keeping the molecules which are important for life in a membrane, isolated from the rest of the environment, but yet, in an environment in which they actually could originate together. 
You saw sites that had never existed before getting huge amounts of traffic. 
Meanwhile, the diaphragm, cervical cap, and sponge work by being placed over the cervix, barricading the entrance to the uterus.

She's exaggerating." 
And I played Weasel Wyzell, who was the sort of dorky, nerdy character on the show, which made it a very major acting challenge for me as a 13-year-old boy. 
Sleep is when the brain transfers short-term memories experienced throughout the day into long-term memories. 
We can zip through them as a possibility. 
With each smack of my head to the concrete ground, a question echoed through my mind that still haunts me today: "Is this going to be how it all ends?" 
And she was quiet, too quiet. 
There's the whole action there, sitting, kind of, on the side, and the dummy head and our recording engineers standing around while we rebuild the piano. 
And my navy blue polo shirt, the one that looks kinda good on me but has that hole on it near the butt from when it got snagged on the chain-link fence behind Arturo's but it isn't even a big deal because I tuck that part in and it's, like, all good.

Companies can give people more control, but they can also give them less control. 
To tell if a part of the brain is necessary for a mental function, you need to mess with it and see what happens, and normally we don't get to do that. 
I propose three strategies. 
They had to believe that they'd increased their self-awareness in their life, and the person rating them had to agree. 
And so, my response to this was to paint, to draw alien creatures, alien worlds, robots, spaceships, all that stuff. 
But can you make a french fry machine out of an old car? 
If so, we'll pay you a million dollars." 
Now, just in case I hadn't learned this lesson, they assigned me to headquarters next, and that's where I ran straight up against system change.

It used to be thought that those sex-determining chromosomes pictured here -- XY if you're male, XX if you're female -- merely determined whether you would be born with ovaries or testes, and it was the sex hormones that those organs produced that were responsible for the differences we see in the opposite sex. 
None of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion. 
The citizens called him a kyôn— a barking dog. 
Well, it seems people are motivated by certain intrinsic values and in our research, we look at this. 
The process of elimination will identify the remaining one. 
This is basically a base wherein we are trying to gather and learn virtually everything about the biodiversity of this incredibly complex forest system, and try to hang on to what's there, make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean, and of course, having a good time too. 
(Applause) So how do we scale Tree Lab? 
But my team and I are confident that we can take this to market within the next two to three years. 
Do you want to try it? 
But we are not critical in interrogating ourselves and asking ourselves, how did I have this view of the world? 
This one guy was musing to I don't know who that maybe I was the definition of a cunt. 
And one way to do it is actually trusting the system that got us here in the first place, and that's the free market system.

But even if there is no signal, electro-stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder. 
And so you can hear oral histories -- so people who were actually working the so-called bucket brigades as you're seeing literally the thousands of experiences from that moment. 
So we're going to have to try a different approach. 
But here's a fascinating irony. 
They broke her bangles. 
What you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss. 
What if that hump -- which, huge news to me, does not contain water, it contains fat -- (Laughter) was there to help the camel get through that six-month-long winter, when food was scarce? 
They jumped into the first, smallest parentheses inside the great Puff the Digit Dragon. 
She's a very serious Swiss artist. 
For me, the stigma is personal. 
But I hope that you are at least partly convinced that it is not impossible to build a brain. 
I've been quite interested in both. 
If we made all of our autos this way, it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half Saudi Arabias, or half an OPEC, by drilling in the Detroit formation, a very prospective play. 
(Laughter) So really, what are we talking about here? 
So penguins learn from previous experience, too. 
They have curiosity. Curiosity about people in the tribe, curiosity about outsiders. They're asking questions. 
I ended up starting this research and education station in Agumbe, which you are all of course invited to visit. 
We gave them a lavish lunch and thanked them for the role they played for freeing up a young woman to work shoulder to shoulder with us to literally change the world. 
"Go ahead, build it." 
These figures couldn't be exact, but we knew those materials were finite. 
Now, methane gets people all excited, because it's organic material, so immediately people start thinking, could life have evolved in that location, when you have a lot of organic material. 
The Chinese restaurant model spreads. 
I didn't. 
I just want to acknowledge that choosing to have babies is a deeply, profoundly personal choice. 
And they are not necessarily couples who constantly can't wait to keep their hands off each other.

Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. 
We're also building exoskeletons. 
(Applause) [Music by: Melodium (@melodiumbox) and Keegan DeWitt (@keegandewitt)] 
Africans can't possibly really be using fractal geometry, right? 
I think there's a lot of people who will want to engage with you. 
Another example is action unit 4. It's the brow furrow. 
Now, the answer began to come when a friend of mine lamented to me that her young daughter was a big scaredy-cat, and so I began to notice, and yes, the daughter was anxious, but more than that, the parents were anxious.

Just for their muscles, giant clams were almost hunted to extinction between the 1960s and 1980s. 
And I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation. 
But the sense of community that is here in Kakuma and the pride that everyone here possesses is simply unparalleled. 
Fifty-four percent of the world's population lives in our cities. 
These are the benefits to play. 
That's great, except the places that have malaria really bad, they don't have health care systems. 
He thinks that we will completely remake ourselves using data, using bioengineering, to become completely new creatures that have, kind of, superpowers, and that there will be huge inequality. 
The locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you. 
RH: Sometimes. 
This is a tiny little signal, so how do I detect it? 
There's a lot of love in these passwords. 
They've created a consumer collective where they put solar panels on households and create a consumer-based utility, where the electricity they generate is basically pumped back out into the marketplace.

Plato is one of the earliest political theorists on record, and with Aristotle, is seen as one of the founders of political science. 
Good afternoon. 
And I think as long as we're really clear about what our agenda is, there's a global movement waiting to happen and ready to get behind this totally uncontroversial idea. 
We developed some other technology called spider optics, and Craig Ventner asked me to make an announcement here this morning: we’re going to be building a beautiful, little, small version of this -- unmanned, super deep -- for his boat to go and get back some deep sea DNA stuff. 
We collect data on animal populations, analyze complex patterns, try to explain them. 
So how is that being accomplished here? 
Dancers who were both men and women were offered to temples where they served as living bridges between heaven and earth. 
It's more than a thing we're doing because we want to create jobs for fishermen or preserve fishermen's jobs. 
I mean, even the stupid "reply all" regrets can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days. 
He was looking for a heart attack, that's what I say. 
So taking this thought experiment, I wanted to go a little bit further and suggest that these things are managed communally, and they are taking care of scarce capital, scarce cash and scarce resources. 
And so we need to do more than that. 
The emblem of the successful. 
You zoom in, there are just four DNA strands and they have little single-stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles, if they match. 
No, I'm not showing you any images, because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink, and space is not painted, showing you the curves. 
I promise you, none of us pops out of the womb hating black people or Republicans. 
Syria suffered one of the worst droughts in its history between 2007 and 2010.

There's nothing special about doorknobs. 
But if you want to go higher and go larger than this, then you might need some origami. 
A few years ago, I met this other woman, Stefanie Posavec -- a London-based designer who shares with me the passion and obsession about data. 
We have a 24-hour street, so that there's always a place that's alive. 
Now I know that you don't have to be a statistician to understand the power and the purpose of data, but you do have to treat people with respect and have compassionate care. 
Second: the type of evidence matters. 
We're looking at ways to make bees healthier through vaccines, through yogurt, like probiotics, and other types of therapies in ways that can be fed orally to bees, and this process is so easy, even a 7-year-old can do it. 
It's all over the Web. 
The pool is already working today, two months later, with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product can go to market at low cost where and when it is needed. This is unprecedented.

We're not trying to control polio. 
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife, in this life, his personality -- his rather unfortunate personality -- is the product of his brain. 
It will be 20 million times more sensitive than the human eye. 
So if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible, by all means, climb in and take the plunge. 
The second thing you should notice is that the bulk of the growth comes from the developing countries, from China, from India, from the rest of the world, which includes South Africa and Indonesia and Brazil, as most of these countries move their people into the lower range of lifestyles that we literally take for granted in the developed world.

Now, if you combine this very simple, very conservative thought -- go with the grain of human nature -- with all the advances in behavioral economics, some of which we were just hearing about, again, I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being, in happiness, in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money. 
And that's because they have better job opportunities and their state offers better social services.

I think they think it's unlikely, but it could happen, which is why they prefer that to the flushing. 
So I've taken this aspect of TED and translated it into something that's physical. 
And so all of the technologies that we have laid out -- the point-of-care testing, the multiplex testing, the discovery and tracking of the virus as it's changing, and the overlay of the mobile applications to dashboard -- are all critical. 
We proved that it's not bad journalism; it's a deliberate act of misinformation. 
When you're different, you have to work at belonging.

And the abundance of animals on display may hint at the bombing’s date– a market day which flooded the streets with villagers, animals, and other potential causalities. 
And we're often not taught to recognize the sin in ourselves, in that we're not taught in this culture how to wrestle with it, how to confront it, and how to combat it. 
Botanists use multiple photographs to show the life cycle of plants and how flowers turn over the course of a few hours to follow the sun in what is called phototropism, growing towards the light.

We're providing affordable, off-the-shelf robot platforms such as the A.R. drone, 300 dollars, the Suitable Technologies beam, only 17,000 dollars, along with open-source robotics software so that you can be a part of what we're trying to do. 
I can also make him spin. 
By any standard this is wrong. 
And because researchers often use a small sample size in a specific setting, it's hard to generalize their results. 
Well, this stuff is going to change the world. 
Maybe all the discussions in real life would be awful. 
There's a very important moral and ethical answer to that, and it is that I do not want the most valuable things on earth, the things I treasure, sitting in an accounting framework that thinks that war is great for growth. 
(Applause) We need a government that works. 
Imagine getting to the end of your life and regretting all that time." 
(Laughter) I mean, I'm screaming at a bag of chips -- (Laughter) -- and we're blasting it with so much light, we literally melted the first bag we tried this on. (Laughter) But ridiculous as this experiment looks, it was actually really important, because we were able to recover this sound. 
And this warm glow of giving persists into adulthood. 
CA: So once it's out, it's out, and you can't put it back in, and you think we've been lucky. 
So they repeated the study, dividing the rabbits into two groups.

And we have to go also beyond traditional diplomacy to the survival issue of our times, climate change. 
Well, the first question is: What does that red space look like?

Now, under proper conditions, which we have here, these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor. 
Not necessarily. 
This doesn't cause any damage. 
I mean, we've been doing it for two million years, so it's kind of arrogant to assume that I've got something to say that hasn't been said and performed better a long time ago. 
And engaging with other scientists, doctors, ethicists and governments to maximize the likelihood that base editing is applied thoughtfully, safely and ethically, remains a critical obligation. 
Right around the same time, we figured out how to record light onto a piece of photographic paper, celluloid -- the beginning of film and television. 
It's funny, someone just mentioned MacGyver, because that was, like, I loved it, and when I was seven, I taped a fork to a drill and I was like, "Hey, Mom, I'm going to Olive Garden."

Second biggest wiki in the world, with nearly 80,000 articles, is the World of Warcraft wiki. 
The other group gets two apples, one is taken away. 
The reason that it attracted so much attention, besides the fact that it's disgusting, is that sea birds flying over it are asphyxiated by the smell and die, and a farmer died of it, and you can imagine the scandal that happened. 
(Laughter) I think it's highly probable Apple wins this thing with market share closer to what they have on the iPod than to what they have on the iPhone. 
And four years later, we're analyzing over 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics on thousands of sneakers. 
I wish you sound health. 
(Applause) Now, I'm not here to give a history lesson. 
So that's a potentially helpful method for getting crowds to solve problems that have simple right-or-wrong answers. 
So, what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price? 
They will be used for our purposes. 
Just like muscle strength, we have to use our brain or risk losing it. 
But it doesn't sound so much, it's not relatively enough, it won't make a difference if you've already committed 100,000 soldiers previously. 
He knows that the sausage is very tasty, but he's going to turn away because he's a good dog. 
For example, it's said that there are more people in India with access to cell phones than toilets. 
You know, we went into it thinking, 40,000 or 50,000 human genes and we came out with only 23,000. 
See, in the real world math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians. 
The success of this project got me thinking how I can take the same methodology to other places in the world. 
It's sure to help. 
Think about insects. 
While electric power, cell service, and Internet would be down, most radios would likely survive. 
It starts with garage at the bottom, I suppose, appropriately, but it doesn't go up garage, grand floor, mezzanine, one, two, three, four. 
My colleagues in infra-red astronomy call minus 200 Kelvin is cool for them.

And the whole class would say, "Shut up, Freeman." 
Now, as an artist, I am creating different lives for my models in order to give them the experience of being someone else in reality. 
It means psychosocial support, medical support, and it's also that back-end employment support that's really resulting in the 95 percent graduation, the 88 percent employment. 
And as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness. 
I then put him to bed, tucked him in, gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Goodnight, mate," and walked out of his bedroom. 
As a young model, my confidence was tugged at and pulled in all different directions. 
As long as we can stay dry, that's a bonus. 
You see, in Oklahoma City, we weren't talking about obesity. 
So what I want to do in the rest of this talk is tell you about what pheromones really are, tell you why I think we would expect humans to have pheromones, tell you about some of the confusions in pheromones, and then finally, I want to end with a promising avenue which shows us the way we ought to be going. 
In London I lived in a glass box for 44 days with nothing but water. 
And the churches built in Palermo combined Latin-style architecture, Arab ceilings, and Byzantine domes, all decorated with exquisite golden mosaics.

RM: Steve isn't ready to reveal his design yet. 
So I was born in Russia, and three years ago, in 2011, there were the Russian federal elections. 
Now, the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we're at a very untypical place, uniquely suited and so on. 
So, as researchers, something that we often do is use immense resources to achieve certain capabilities, or achieve certain goals. 
You are the products of evolution. 
And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe but for the whole global economy. 
And sometimes there were shocking realizations, and other times there were tears, but mostly it was laughs. 
TM: My name is Tendai Mugwagwa and I was a student at AIMS in 2003 and 2004. 
Now as engineers, we think of this as straight-up miniaturization. 
That's not the way history works.

That's not what I'm saying at all. 
But that's not completely true. 
A meritocratic society is one in which, if you've got talent and energy and skill, you will get to the top, nothing should hold you back.

We start with a human interface, and then we have to think about how feces are collected and stored, transported, treated and reused — and not just disposal but reuse. 
We need more love in our society and that's why we are here to share the love with children, because our children will lead the way for us, because all of us will depend on our children. 
So let me begin by urging you, particularly you on the youngsters' side, on this path you've chosen, to go as far as you can. 
(Applause) Thank you. Sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company. 
And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good. 
But for them, the truth was dangerous.

It will create huge opportunities in technology. 
On that particular Friday, she developed severe respiratory distress, and her eyes were menacingly red. 
I'm going to do some demonstrations. 
(Laughter) Is it because his name is really Jupiter Blunck?

So that's how they bring it in. 
He's built schools to teach children to care for the forest. 
At the same time, if you think about it, there's all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us.

It supports farmers close to home. 
The innovation of the terrorist operations center gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness and tactical advantage over the police and over the government. 
So, we can't measure it, but we can, like we just did, calculate it. 
When relevant and irrelevant thoughts compete for the same attention, something has to give. 
Now, maybe it's because they want to -- this is authentically how they feel best -- but maybe -- and I bet -- a part of them felt like they had to in order to reach the level of success that they have attained today. 
Not with my words and not with my actions." 
(Laughter) My father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for PH, but after six months, I couldn't walk up a small hill. I couldn't climb a flight of stairs. 
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting. 
It was a very interesting academic article in which I found that 67 percent of singles in America today who are living long-term with somebody, have not yet married because they are terrified of divorce. 
These are potential sources for high-speed data transmission. 
My mistake is that I didn't stay involved or understand what was going on with our money. 
So, I think you're dealing with something that people instinctively see as part of their moral sense. 
When you flex your ankle, muscles in the front of your leg contract, simultaneously stretching muscles in the back of your leg.

We simply want true and full equality. 
They all believe that other people have to stop demonizing. 
I think that it won't be too long till we're using robots to help take care of our parents, or probably more likely, have our children help take care of us.

So that's just what we did. 
The first time you ever see a blue-green signature on a distant planet, it means there's photosynthesis there, there's water there, and the chances that you saw the only other planet with photosynthesis are about zero. 
But basically, you're going to lift off from a pad, you've got a booster as well as the BFS, the Big Falcon Spaceship. 
Let me say that again. 
My friends think I do. 
So how can you figure out what’s a genuine health concern or a truly promising remedy, and what’s less conclusive? 
If you line up 295 of those nose to tail, that's about how far back that was. 
I didn't really know what this meant. 
She's like, "Oh, us." I'm like, "Okay. All right. That's cool." 
Our mission is simple: ask Black women, 80 percent of whom are over a healthy body weight, to walk outside of their front door every day to establish a lifesaving habit of walking; in doing so, ignite a radical movement in which Black women reverse the devastating impacts of chronic disease, reclaim the streets of their neighborhoods, create a new culture of health for their families and stand on the front lines for justice. 
And here's another project, another partnership-type approach. 
It's unforgivable that we live in a society where it's normal or expected for teenagers to grow up hating themselves. 
And the gears work in water as well. 
CA: But you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power. 
Many of them would be unemployable. 
Here's how you judge what you're doing: I talked about that balance between intuitive, analytical. 
The resell market, we know, is $1.2 billion. 
I mean, I showed you a computer model, but a computer is not understanding. 
As somebody who finds mass surveillance odious for all the reasons I just talked about and a lot more, I mean, I look at this as work that will never end until governments around the world are no longer able to subject entire populations to monitoring and surveillance unless they convince some court or some entity that the person they've targeted has actually done something wrong. 
The richest country. 
Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language that allows it to count its own siblings.

It is inhabited over time. 
And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month. 
This market represented more money. 
That's me and my son on the floor. 
With that in mind, one way we can start is to work backwards from the three defects that could knock you out of the race. 
It seems that with or without us, life will go on.

There are only two freestanding pediatric hospices in the United States, although I'm happy to report that based on our model, there are 18 others under various stages of development. 
I built an evolving, still-growing database at baratunde.com/livingwhileblack. 
I don't think anybody is really thinking of abolishing that. 
The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies -- and it doesn't matter who they are -- they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information, or restricted access to information. 
We're not treating the brain injury, we're treating the underlying problem that gets people into all of this trouble in the first place.

So my friend Melissa and I sat down and we wrote an email which we sent out to a few friends and colleagues. 
Look in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa -- probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now, around 60, 70 thousand years ago -- allowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa. 
But there is a dimension of life that storytelling could never really reproduce.

This is the only device he needs in this treatment. 
When you sit in a room with a small group of people making decisions, what do you get? 
The question had to be asked, "Well, can we do these same surgeries but through little incisions?" 
We were told in many ways, implicitly and explicitly, that in spelling, something fundamental to our upbringing was at stake. 
And so again, when you start bringing these worlds together -- me, Curtis, Bette -- you get something more incredible. 
They're really high resolution, and they're really showing us what we can do with standard graphics cards today. 
So a lot of it tends to be extrinsic. 
We put together, very quickly, a washroom. 
Other animals use mimicry to protect themselves. 
We can be fooled -- we're really good at fooling ourselves.

TED dance. Okay. Here it comes. I'm going to organize it quickly. 
(Laughter) Ilkka Hanski was an ecologist in Finland, and he did this experiment himself. 
The different frequencies produce the different particles. 
That's not something we have in real life that easily, this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators. 
And what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies to the clinic, we've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients. 
Your headmaster said to you -- I mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school -- he said, you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison, and I'm not sure which. 
And that can happen with awareness -- awareness of the reality of oneness and the projection of self-hood. 
Something incurable. 
So whereas in the adults, as I told you, this brain region is almost completely specialized -- it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people's thoughts -- in children it's much less so, when they are age five to eight, the age range of the children I just showed you. 
Why don't you let your family stay home, because you do know that you get a 30-day leave. 
Let me share with you recent work that we did around the Pribilof Islands. 
And yet, a few years earlier, death never crossed their mind. 
We can change these values, can change the companies we work with, and eventually, together, maybe we can change the world. 
The bubble gum was chewed up by pop star Britney Spears and sold for several hundreds of dollars. 
We spend 50 billion dollars on vegetables, which is why we need all the diet aids. 
A particular type of scientist, called a cosmologist, spends her time thinking about that very question. 
When we're told that banking is a very respectable profession, a lot of us want to go into banking. 
I'm frequently out of my depth. 
And the reason I'm saying this is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent. 
Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz, and there is only energy. 
So let's go back to that blow up the terrorist's phone situation. 
This is also partly a result of the Internet revolution. 
It can put the price tag of state-sponsored violence over a nonviolent protester. 
You throw something in the ocean, "Hey, it'll just sit there forever.

Here are all the ones that are proven and left on the books, 28 trillion dollars. 
The vertical axis is just percent per year of growth, zero percent a year, one percent a year, two percent a year. 
I took more photos, and we started the project. 
A book cover is a distillation. 
The physical book itself represents both a technological advance but also a piece of technology in and of itself. 
Why are the leadership gaps widening when there's so much more investment in leadership development? 
You just have to change how you think. 
And quite interestingly, over something like a 60-year period, we're seeing the doubling in life expectancy, over that period where the urbanization has trebled. 
Cold air from the top of the mountain was flowing down this hole and blasting through the cave, freezing everything inside of it. 
This race-to-the-finish strategy produced the first testable Zika vaccine in 7 months, and the first testable COVID-19 vaccine in just 42 days. 
And so I act in an extroverted way, because at eight in the morning, the students need a little bit of humor, a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study. 
But you get up at 4 a.m. 
And the answer is no. 
And so now I do know at least some of the calculus that underlies all of that stuff. 
And a few semesters ago, one of my more cheerful students, Mahari, actually came to see me and mentioned that he was feeling a bit like an outcast because he's black. 
Because the human thing is very hard when you're at MIT. 
Remove most of the quantitative metrics to assess performance. 
You know, there is a fear of dying, and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid.

What we've done so far is we have a few surrogate talkers from around the U.S. 
That seemed really like a crisis to me, that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape, and about travel, and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell. 
I've learned that borders are where the actual ends, but also where the imagination and the story begins. 
The first was Katharine Hepburn's memoirs, and the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich. 
Landscaping. 
(Laughter) But there is a saying in my culture that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something, that bud is a young one. 
It's a mind setting. 
I learned a lot, and I found I really do need, like most people, eight hours of sleep. 
This is actually watching a delivery happen from our distribution center; this vehicle is about 50 kilometers away. 
Devote yourself to love. 
In a hard choice, one alternative is better in some ways, the other alternative is better in other ways, and neither is better than the other overall. 
I paid attention only when you began to vote and shout, and when your voting and shouting, when the substance of it, began to threaten me. 
I don't want to get into that, you know; that's not my point. 
X is the unknown because you can't say "sh" in Spanish. 
If too much current is flowing, the intelligent receptacle turns itself off, and prevents another fire from starting. 
And because this device is designed to address the physics of puncture and not the specifics of cranial drilling or laparoscopic surgery, or another procedure, it's applicable across these different medical disciplines and across different length scales. 
The second string is a melody string, which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano. 
They want us to fit in even better. 
This is the cord. 
It has never been done. 
You have US lawyers arguing that kids do not need soap or hugs or showers, adult help or a release date. 
But there's really no separation anymore between the internet and everything else. 
There's a benefit of 400 million years of ambulation.

It requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self-defining act. 
(Music) Now it's looking at me, showing that it's listening. 
There are problems of sewage overflow and contamination, but I would also argue that almost every city has this exact condition, and it's a condition that we're all facing. 
Too much efficiency can weaken itself. 
This mere-exposure effect doesn't just work for songs. 
And he plays with this idea. 
So when I virtually touch data, it will generate forces in the pen, so I get a feedback. 
This involves solving the famous Navier-Stokes equations to find the variation of pressure in the air due to the supersonic aircraft flying through it. 
Well ... 
(Laughter) That's back from high school algebra. 
It's a finite resource; it's always draining away. 
It's a little bit like termites, really. 
So that's what we did, and long story short, we were booed off the stage, and if you ever have a chance to live your life escaping hearing the sound of an auditorium full of second- and third-graders booing, I would highly recommend it. It's not really fun. 
The average depth is about two miles. 
These mixed-race slaves are related to the slave masters and had more Anglo features, and were given preferential treatment and allowed to work inside the house, doing less strenuous work, as opposed to the darker skinned slaves that had to work out in the fields, doing more laborious work.

In just five years, their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people. 
(Laughter) HP: (In Chinese) YR: The only problem with masking it with Chinese Mandarin is I can only speak this paragraph, which I have learned by heart when I was visiting in China. (Laughter) So all I can do is keep repeating it in different tones and hope you won't notice. 
What if several of the high-net worth companies and individuals who are here at TED decided that they would create, band together, just a couple of them, and create a national competition to the governors to have a race to the top and see how the governors respond? 
I literally drew on the walls of the trailer, mocked it up in cardboard, we'd come in and cut, decide things were wrong, pull it out, put it back in. 
I'm going to talk about using these strategies to actually design brain plasticity-based approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child that increases the competence of the child as a language receiver and user and, thereafter, as a reader. 
He said, "Choice, not chance, determines your destiny." 
After making 75 robes, I had an epiphany.

On average, those students were able to stay on task for only six minutes at a time. 
The gender-climate connection extends beyond negative impacts and beyond powerful solutions. 
If you take some jelly and some salts, and do a bit of jiggery-pokery, you can make an artificial muscle. 
What we do is we look at every speaking or named character on-screen. 
Now, everyone else had assumed it was, and we knew it was, because we were working with it. 
And the girl goes, "Wha'?"

She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat. 
I probably have the most comprehensive digital me on the planet.

But if it didn't, you're out. 
The Canadian Centre for Child Protection just did a recent study of these young adults to understand the unique trauma they try to recover from, knowing that their abuse lives on.

This wasn't a comments section. 
The feuds in the playroom that play out over favoritism, birth order and so many other issues are as unrelenting as they seem. 
This risk management ability will have broad applications in finance and insurance. 
(Laughter) We've personified these companies, and just as when you're really angry over every little thing someone does in your life and relationships, you've got to ask yourself, "What's going on here? Why are we so disappointed in technology?" 
So they design communities that incorporate water, fruit trees, flowers and animals into their common spaces on site. 
Opinion polls from all over the Muslim world show that there is very little interest among Muslims in a global holy war against the West, against the far enemy. 
Those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens, it cannot be the right strategy, either pragmatically, or spiritually, or morally, to say after the war, "Well, let's let it all run itself out, and play out however it wants to play out, because we opposed the war in the first place." 
And eventually, if you're lucky, you achieve mastery. 
And they trained 50,000 bombardiers on how to use them -- long extensive, months-long training sessions -- because these things are essentially analog computers; they're not easy to use. 
So this would just be another example of clothes that exist in our wardrobe that evolve with us over our lives. 
What if we could mobilize our leadership and our resources, our influence and our passion, to replicate the Bhutan For Life idea to other countries so that they too can conserve their protected areas for all time. 
Shouldn't we just provide pills and procedures and just make sure we focus on the task at hand?" 
But then after a while I realized, this is my life. 
Now, even though we're combining the translations, the site actually can translate pretty fast. 
I guess so. Because in a way, if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything, it's the forging of a mass awareness, of where everybody can really know everything that's going on everywhere in the planet. 
But it's all UVA, and, significantly, that UVA has no ability to make vitamin D in your skin. 
Perhaps the most impressive of these ocean-dwelling ancients is the Antarctic glass sponge, which can survive over 10,000 years in frigid waters.

With each rereading, I learned something new about the hard stones of the roads that the kids were forced to play on when they got expelled from the garden, about the gentleness of a small boy that appeared one day, and even about the Giant himself. 
And then I thought about how, much as travel insurance doesn't cover acts of God, probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy. 
And in all, it took us more than three years to collate all of this information, crunch the numbers, and write our report. 
This is [Albert] Gonzalez. 
Now, many events can be subject to either construal, kind of like the classic figure-ground reversal illusions, in which you can either pay attention to the particular object, in which case the space around it recedes from attention, or you can see the faces in the empty space, in which case the object recedes out of consciousness. 
If you look closely, you'll see there's a little white and gray fish that hangs out near them. 
You're going to end up on the side of the Earth, falling down, and now the Earth is pulling you back in sideways. 
And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid, or you know, flip through them like a book or I can lay them out like a deck of cards. 
And watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail when it slips. This is slowed down 10 times.

You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal. 
We are tuition free. 
For example, the design and analysis of molecules for drug development is a challenging problem today, and that's because exactly describing and calculating all of the quantum properties of all the atoms in the molecule is a computationally difficult task, even for our supercomputers. 
A job means food and shelter. 
Sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion -- you name it, it amplifies the violence endured by girls and women, and for our younger girls, it is worse. 
Magic can be taught. 
There's always new work to do. 
This is the type and quality of data that you all will get to see. 
And this is while holding 50 pounds of draw weight on each shot. 
But we're humans -- we're terrestrial mammals. 
November 1, 2010 began just like any other day. 
Small things, like atoms or electrons though, can have wavelengths big enough to measure in physics experiments. 
And we'll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz, or 1760. 
And what we show here is -- like, here -- very few people are affected, more and more and more and up to here, and here's the peak of the epidemic. 
And what we find is, amnesiac patients just guess. 
When I ran out of the building at three in the morning, I saw something that stopped me in my tracks. 
This was happening everywhere. 
But to see something like the $100 computer is amazing, because blogging software is simple.

ZK: As we were talking to the vendor -- to try to learn about how you could apply these, or how they're being applied currently -- he was telling us that, in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very concealed -- and then, when they're out on the field, erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base. 
And see, this is what they did to Rosa Parks. 
And we have plans to replicate it in Washington D.C., Detroit, New York and New Orleans.

I think it's baked into culture in really deep ways. 
The trick was, they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost-efficient manner, which is why it took so long for people to copy them -- 10 years, then within a couple months, it was such a hit, they introduced it across the entire McDonald's system in the country.

It's true. For how much, do you think? 
We've mentioned the health, but it needs consumers to buy into it. 
So we can go back in earth's time and do these kinds of reconstructions and understand how earth's landscape has changed in response to a climate event like this or a land use event. 
Of course, power was sweet. 
I will deliver something based on what happens. It's very scary -- that's what Google does, essentially. 
And it's the reason that normally they're run by the council or by a not-for-profit group.

This music will change your life. 
Then there was two years after that of refining and implementing the tool, like in the operations in Iraq and other countries. 
So which is worse? 
And so we have to be aware of that when we're studying science and when we're trying to develop our theses. 
Frank Calvert was one such believer. 
What's so fascinating up there?" 
We have very, very smart people, who are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem, and we have the technology to do this. 
But of course, that's not all you do -- there's 15 pies. 
We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games. 
My mother was an artist, my father was a college professor, and I am truly grateful for my upbringing, because I always felt completely comfortable designing my life exactly as I saw fit.

In fact, the ratio between the two, the circumference divided by the diameter, will always be the same number, no matter how big or small the circle gets. 
Well, I think they can tell us something about human time. 
It's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human. 
Not to put too fine a point on it, the moment we're living through -- the moment our historical generation is living through -- is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history. 
She just looked exhausted. 
This illustrates the power of a conservative climate solution based on free markets and limited government. 
Hopefully it won't stutter.

In "No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?" 
The LED is the next best thing to daylight. 
We just want to try and create that awareness because, sure, changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world, but that attitude, that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug, that is what could change the world. 
But how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject? 
What a burden we have." I would like to ask you to reframe that. How many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts? 
There are three featured in the film. 
A light came on in the hallway. 
She is already out in the streets, working with the party to try to rebuild it. 
There is gay marriage and sperm donors and there's intermarriage on an unprecedented scale, and this makes some of my more conservative cousins a little nervous, but I actually think it's a good thing.

Instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem, design the solution around what the human will do as well. 
Form and content are together here. 
I personally experienced the shock and grief because I was in Manhattan when 9/11 happened.

So we were very excited when we captured our first pair of orangutan nests on camera. 
It is the major difference between birds and any other animals we have on earth, and if you can't make a feather, you cannot call yourself a bird. 
So if we think about an extreme weather event that might happen in some part of the world, and if that happens in a part of the world where there is good infrastructure, where there are people that are well-insured and so on, then that impact can be disruptive. 
Finally, as a machine, I could exchange energy with the world via haptics. 
Have you ever laughed or smiled when someone said something shitty to you and then spent the rest of the day wondering why you reacted that way? 
What color is urban? 
So I tried to find it. 
It starts with a foundation, basic skills. 
The question that I came up with was this question: what does technology want? And by that, I don't mean, does it want chocolate or vanilla? By what it wants, I mean, what are its inherent trends and biases? 
And at the risk of sounding grandiose, it is the world's loss. 
So this is all done in the last two years. 
I have worked on this for over 14 years, and I can tell you, the results are very good. 
Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top. 
So now I have to improvise again. 
Adoration is a projection of someone's need for you to be perfect onto you. 
There is the old saying that just about every story can be summed up as "a stranger came to town." 
So those tended to live longer, get expressed more. 
Because each bit must be written onto a physical area of the disc, we're always seeking to increase the disc's areal density, or how many bits can be squeezed into one square inch. 
The scan of today takes up about 800 books, or 20 gigabytes. 
I did no longer want him to die or to murder him, and I felt free, much freer than I'd ever felt before. 
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things. 
Though they’re aware of Bokonism’s lies, they live their lives by these tenets anyway, and in so doing develop some genuine hope. 
And for many decades now there have been a series of TOMS satellites that have collected data about the radiation of the Earth's surface. 
I'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity. 
Of the total respondents who admitted to appearance-based covering, 82 percent said that it was somewhat to extremely important for them to do so for their professional advancement. 
These topics are banned. 
Oma's like melanoma, lymphoma -- cancer. 
When Beethoven starts off, he doesn't have a piano that can do this.

And that atmosphere is very -- as dense as our own atmosphere. 
They lay the eggs into fresh water. 
The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage, which is the force feeding. 
Put another way, that's enough water to immerse the entire United States under a body of salt water over 132 kilometers tall, a height well beyond the reach of the highest clouds and extending deep into the upper atmosphere. 
The best way to find out is simply to talk to them. 
Why did I do that? 
The history of surgery is filled with breakthroughs in how science and technology was able to help the surgeons of the day face their greatest challenges. 
If we can treat hypertension alone in Africa, we'll save 250,000 lives a year. That's quite significant! 
In the Himalayas, the third largest mass of ice: at the top you see new lakes, which a few years ago were glaciers.

It's allowed us to increase our ambition in what the foundation can do quite dramatically. 
Those are the three pages. That's it. That's fear-setting. 
When I was a young boy, I used to gaze through the microscope of my father at the insects in amber that he kept in the house. 
In my day job, I'm a policy adviser. 
So to conclude part one: we're completely screwed. 
So to invoke the serpent in your dancing body then was to conjure the image of rivers cutting across the earth: inspire the flow of life-giving waters. 
One of the reasons this is so important to me, is because of all the reaction that I've experienced all around the world. 
They also live deep. 
And so, local people have started growing their own glaciers as insurance against this uncertainty. 
Let's increase the websites that they crawl from 20,000 to 20 million. 
(Laughter) So, here we are. 
And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem. 
As I had no reference point for my body, I began to ask other women about their bodies -- in particular, their vaginas, because I thought vaginas were kind of important. 
Well, what should you do? What's the best way to handle it? 
And with problems that we are not aware of yet, the ability to put right -- not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely -- is our only hope, not just of solving problems, but of survival. 
Jamal was brilliant, but unfocused. 
In the technology world, a killer app is an application so transformative that it creates its own market, like Uber. 
Later in the camps, hospitals and through our online clinic that breaks down borders and overcomes languages. 
One, to give us the humility and courage to not know. 
Well, religious ritual and rites were essentially designed to serve the function of the anniversary, to be a container in which we would hold on to the remnants of that sacred, revelatory encounter that birthed the religion in the first place. 
And it now has a hand that can do different grasps. 
So, what we've done is we've succeeded in making something much bigger than a DNA origami by combining DNA origami with tiles. 
And I can tell you about the legislator who despite heavy lobbying directed at both sides of the aisle pushes for environmental protections. 
And so in 1967, Joe opened the Public Theater downtown on Astor Place, and the first show he ever produced was the world premiere of "Hair." 
We used to live in tribes where we interacted, communicated and worked together. 
Now, what came out on the page was about as strange as I felt at that time, which alarmed some people at first. 
So I rang up, asked Paul Farmer if he would help. 
Bike volumes have spiked. 
So two things struck me deeply about this. 
He's developing energy in this area through thought. 
There's a very important issue here, which is that because it's a printer, a color printer, it prints colors. 
DW: The group. We all agreed on it. 
The key is to carefully formulate our questions so that any answer yields useful information. 
You know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him. 
So many years ago, you may remember that former President Ronald Reagan was very criticized for making a statement that facts are stupid things. 
Still, these are big, important artists, but still, when you look at these works and you look at the headlines, you have to ask yourself, "Do I care about these because they move me, or do I care about them because they're expensive and I think they're supposed to?"

That's when Jesuit missionaries in Peru discovered the bark of the cinchona tree, and inside that bark was quinine, still an effective cure for malaria to this day. 
It's really no coincidence that these institutions are largely set up in areas where tourists can most easily be lured in to visit and volunteer in exchange for donations. 
One of our problems is that world food production needs to increase very rapidly -- doubling by about 2030. 
To give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat, we did another cheesy illustration, with British double-decker buses. 
By looking into this Chinese traditional painting, I found that they often mixed the nature and the artificial, man-made, in a very dramatic way, so they create this emotional scenery. 
For each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable, mainly lately in developing countries. 
So the next time you download a gigabyte, or two gigabytes, it’s not for free, OK? 
The chances of getting so many of those vertical columns where every species has a C or every species has a T, by random chance, are infinitesimal. 
Otherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this. 
We look at a number of different data elements. 
I read many of them. 
And it goes on. 
I'm going to first tell you something that in my grandmother would've elicited a five-oy alarm: "Oy-oy-oy-oy-oy." 
It's absolutely amazing -- and they text you back the answer. 
If we only include, for example, in GDP, those activities that have prices, all sorts of really weird things happen. 
Of course, the women were much more intelligent than the men. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Now I would argue that, once stung, the cockroach isn't a roach anymore. 
The couch has replaced the commons. 
We would build projects together, like model rockets and slot cars. 
And let's start to speak up when people are assailing us with the noise that I played you early on. 
That all changed with Joan. 
So my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one I'm about to show you. 
It's made by specialized luthiers, also in Europe.

There's a young director, Hollywood director, with his friends -- fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means. 
Only 3,000, not much more than 1 percent, are actually prosecuted, and the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization -- a ship like my submarine, or a battalion in the Army or a company in the Marines -- the commanding officer has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not, and of course, the last thing they want is for anybody to know that under their command, sexual assaults are taking place, so they do not do it. 
The Web doesn't know that that is actually a town, and that it's a specific town that I live in, but that's what we're going to be talking about.

We wanted to create another type of intimacy using all those new technologies. 
Many, many years before, I had been fired from a job that I loved, and I would not stop talking about my innocence and the injustice and the betrayal and the deceipt, until finally, just like this woman, people were walking away from me, until I finally realized I wasn't just processing my feelings, I was feeding them. 
And so very simple things -- off-the-shelf technologies that we could easily find on the then-early Web -- would clearly make a huge difference to that problem. 
We need independent corroboration. 
Where there was once hope, now there is convenient space, and good mileage, good mileage. 
And this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy. 
I would like you to pay attention to something. 
Thank you for putting your hand up over there. 
(Applause) CA: Amazing. 
Now, I'm not a philosopher, so I feel like I shouldn't go into great depth on this, but let film speak for itself and take you to this other world.

The teenagers said they could see very well. 
(Laughter) But the theme of this session, of course, is invention. 
Every living cell, every living cell ever, has made every one of its proteins using a four-letter genetic alphabet. 
(Laughter) True story, by the way. 
We know this because scientists have recovered DNA from ancient humans that lived hundreds of thousands of years ago. 
You can say, "Biff drove the car to Chicago," but not, "Biff drove Chicago the car." 
The second thing I want to do is introduce my co-author and dear friend and co-teacher.

How could this have happened?" 
Sense education is what I needed as girl. 
The basic idea is that if you want your citizens to walk, which is kind of beneficial, you actually need to have walking as a reasonable means of transportation. 
I also discovered that an IR mouse responds to CRT emissions and starts to move by itself, so this is a self-drawing machine. 
Values are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed -- the two opposing mechanisms. 
Over 17 goals, there are then 169 targets and literally hundreds of indicators. 
And these are not used for bonuses or for promotions. 
Audience: 162.

She knows them very well. She knows who they all are. 
That ability to send a message saying, "This is where I am," is really, really important. 
Yeah, it was when I was pushing that damn stroller. 
Another possible place to look comes from the concept that finite computing power, no matter how huge, can’t simulate infinities. 
Since returning to Gaul, she has received many offers of marriage– but she has decided to devote herself to her work, at least for now. 
And it's been missing. It's been missing from psychotherapy. 
Now, this is a technology arena, so obviously these things are quite popular, but I think if we're going to keep designing, buying and using and throwing out these kinds of products at the rate we currently do, which is astronomically high, there are seven billion people who live in the world right now. 
Let's not be. 
Such decays involve the exchange of force-carrying particles, called the W and Z, which – unlike the photon – have mass. 
And when Lionel started his bakery, the French pooh-pooh-ed it. 
And one of the great experts in this field, of course, was, bless him, Cardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads because it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards, right? 
(Laughter) What's happening on this stuff is it was really expensive to begin with. 
And for many of us, our fortunes do indeed lie at the bottom of the pyramid. Thank you. 
Let's think about this in the construct of security professionals. 
It looks like women got some power boost on a video game, or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high. 
(Applause) It's really important, because that's the way people are going to look differently at their own culture, at their own land.

The problem is hydrodynamics. 
You wouldn't end up homeless. 
It's the whole planet, the entire planet, continents and oceans together. 
ES: So, I've got to give credit to the NSA for using appropriate names on this. 
This little thing says here: five times what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all -- already, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it, you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that being committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed and planned for the next few years.

Now, how does this work? Well, there is these smart Band-Aids or these sensors that one would put on, on a shoe or on the wrist. 
(Laughter) Because we have to trust that it's the process in the sandbox that will reveal to us which ideas are not only surprising, but surprisingly reliable. 
Today we have choices. 
So here, we've got the same character.

It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned 40. 
Our son Burhan is five years old, and he's learning to read and do basic maths. 
I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them. 
That means there is nothing to feel, so we can have a very, very flexible interface. 
They want to know, when they talk to you and share an idea, did you consider it when you made a decision? 
He said GDP "measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile." 
Inflation happens when goods and services get more expensive. 
So that is an actual fact, in my belief. 
My desire to create a sensor-based technology perhaps stemmed from my lifelong love for sensors and technology. 
You can see that this is an important story; there are a lot of things in its orbit. If we open this up, we get different perspectives on this story. 
I really wanted to understand what it meant to just let color rule, to trust my instincts, to stop asking for permission. 
You know, they're not going to change just out of nowhere. 
When people think about making pan-viral detection reagents, usually it's the fast-evolving problem that's an issue, because how can we detect things if they're always changing? 
And we want public transportation, lots of it, public transportation that is clean and dignifying. 
And we have totally forgotten foods like huge varieties of tubers, tree saps, fish, shellfish, oil seeds, mollusks, mushrooms, insects, small, nonendangered animal meats, all of which used to be available right within our surroundings. 
Or, "You know what, I'll look it up, I'll ask someone, I'll phone someone. I'll find out." 
Commerce, on the other hand, is relatively quick, essentially creative, highly effective and efficient, and fundamentally honest, because we can't exchange value for very long if we don't trust each other. 
Teddy still gets all of the customers north in Teddy territory, but now you split the 25% of people in between the two carts.

His father believes the martial arts are more important than the literary arts, so Banshirô doesn’t mention his artistic ambitions. 
We'd take action. It may not be good action, but we would take action. 
We'd have to find an existence. 
And that's because of cumulative emissions, or the carbon budget. 
In between, perhaps some more realistic options on the transport lever are electric vehicles, so electric bikes and electric cars in the middle, perhaps four times as energy efficient as the standard petrol-powered tank. 
Second, and this one is specific to the organs from the pig, every pig carries a virus that is benign to the pig, but can be transmitted into humans. 
We started by making a 350,000-dollar loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa so that they could transfer technology from Japan and build these long-lasting, five-year nets. 
My grandfather was the guy who kind of got me into all sorts of these things. 
Sometimes in the media, and even more rarely, but sometimes even scientists will say that something or other has been scientifically proven. 
In the example I shared with you today, we had two goals. 
Band Aid, Live Aid. 
So when you go to these all-natural, organic markets, you're really going to a place where people have been changing the lifecode of plants for a long time. 
Infectious diseases are still the main cause of human suffering and death around the world. 
Each of these blobs that you see, or voxels, as they're called, can contain millions and millions of neurons. 
And we worked hard, and we thought about it and we said, "What's something we can use all the time, that we can use in the medical care system, that everyone will understand?" 
She studied health care like me. 
And it got me wondering: If you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis, could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk? 
So what are we going to do? 
And what we can see is that just over these few weeks, we have a much more radical change, a setback of many months of normal development, followed by a relatively rapid recovery, and by the time he reaches day 838, which is the end of this video, you can see that he has essentially reached the healthy adult stool community, despite that antibiotic intervention. 
There are so many people who prefer to suffer in the ice they know instead of taking the risk of going through the ice to see what there is on the other side.

Every time you flush the toilet, I want you to think, "Where is my poop and pee going? 
And that it's rampant in my company's home town. 
And ask yourself, what problem have you solved, ever, that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance; where you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out, or you didn't have sufficient information and had to go find some. 
(Cymbal) And they're all like, "Whoa, muthafucker! 
Though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me before the surgery, she didn't leave my side in the months of recovery that followed. 
In a time ... 
This is why you have checks and balances. 
And then she went, "Hmm, OK, he's not mad." 
We as people are not defined by the conditions we face, no matter how hopeless they seem. 
But applying these -- and we've done this dozens of times, we know that this works. 
You've got to persist through failure. You've got to persist through crap! 
We like our suffering because it's so good when it ceases for a while." 
So, we've been conducting a lot of research. 
So does this mean that if I went to heaven, I would get my old uterus back?"

I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling. 
So when you squish your shoulders, they pull on a bicycle cable. 
This same mechanism, we hope, will allow these patients, not only to imagine again the movements that they want to make and translate them into movements of this new body, but for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls. 
And I'm here for the other misfits in the room, because I'm never the only one. 
CA: So maybe the case is slightly overstated? 
So the hardest part of tagging, now, is after you put that tag on, you have to wait, months. 
So the potential for VR is enormous. 
He said, "OK, why don't we try and collect the birds at the greatest risk of getting oiled" -- they collected 20,000 -- "and we'll ship them 500 miles up the coast to Port Elizabeth in these open-air trucks, and release them into the clean waters there and let them swim back home?" 
What's the fastest growing threat to Americans' health? 
Over the years, it's gotten easier to use. 
It does, because that was Hogwart's and that's Harvard. 
Do they follow through? 
And as time passed, the strangest thing started to happen. 
This is not what it's all about. 
And you'd think, "Can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity?" 
We all ate meals together, played basketball together. 
Those may be balanced. 
And we all do it no matter how powerful you are. 
Henry was captured, while Margaret fled into exile with their reportedly cruel son, Edward of Westminster. 
High pressure builds over India.

But as you look at it, I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy. 
Tremendous use. 
This version of love allows us to say things like, "Hey, we're not very good collaborators. Maybe this isn't for us." 
What made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with was just the gorgeous colors he uses and the light falling on her face. 
George Boole took Leibniz's binary code and created Boolean algebra, and John von Neumann took Boolean algebra and created the digital computer. 
You take that six billion minutes and you divide it by the average life expectancy of a person, that turns out to be 162 lifetimes spent every day, wasted, just getting from A to B. 
The music becomes eerie, the lighting creates complete shadows, this has to be bad for the hero! 
This coming year is the critical year. 
So that when we ask, "Can a computer write poetry?" 
I would want anyone I was writing for to be in that place emotionally with the things that I create. 
The war between the sexes is built right into our DNA, according to this vision. Right? 
(Laughter) Or they mention cube roots or ask me to recite a long number or long text. 
But what about you? What's it going to do to you? 
I found myself through music. 
It's the moment where you're so lost in your work or a cause, you have totally self-forgotten.

There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own. 
Thank you everybody. 
Why use triangles? 
And I care so much about this question, that I work for a nonprofit called Recode. 
The courts have said over and over again, "You don't need any more intellectual property protection." 
It's just a quick video of what we do. 
The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it, as well as wastewater. 
The New York Times called this building a miracle. 
How did it make you feel during and after it happened? 
Yet in my country and many others, half of all the people who were ever addicted to cigarettes have quit without anyone being arrested or put in jail or sent to a "treatment program" by a prosecutor or a judge. 
Secondly, I should have given him a little more hope. 
PM: Needing new role models on how to do that. 
We're living in a culture of jet lag, global travel, 24-hour business, shift work. 
So, moving on swiftly. 
And I want to use an example of Rio that we're doing in Madureira, in this region, to see what we should think as our first commandment. 
My reaction to that objection is I think that is nonsense. 
Could we cultivate these NASA-type microbes in order to make valuable products here on Earth? 
And there was a moment in the book that struck me as being deeply problematic, and so I said, "Fred," as we were sitting around talking about this draft, I said, "Fred, I've got a real problem with this moment that you talk about your maid in your book." 
And I can turn them all on, and you can see them moving across the sky now. 
I ended up with this: my Maltese Falcon. 
"Divulge a personal secret." 
And yet one more tap, and you'd be "liking" Auntie Glenda on Facebook. 
They do not match! 
Just being able to visit places in different times, you can explore this for hours, literally hours on end, but I want to show you one thing in particular, so I'm going to open up the destination tab, spacecraft outer planet missions, Voyager 1, and I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby. 
When I joined as finance minister, I thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent. 
There are actually thousands of species of mosquitos in the world, but they all share one insidious quality: they suck blood, and they're really, really good at sucking blood. 
CA: You're spending, like, a billion dollars a year in education, I think, something like that. 
So I thought, forget the rock opera, forget the bombast, my usual tricks. 
For instance, the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Washington, my home state -- yoohoo, Washington! 
And that is, I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists. 
But now the idea of jihad has been hijacked. 
We've been living under a white man's name. 
So to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something that Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session. 
Jared Ficklin: Thank you. (Applause) There are 1,400 stars. 
And that's so very important because we live, as no doubt you're sick of hearing people tell you, in a globalized, hyperconnected, massively interdependent world where the political decisions of people in other countries can and will have an impact on our lives no matter who we are, no matter where we live. 
And perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism, that the personal is in fact the political. 
Then you would pick up your house keys, walk out the door into the real world, maybe take public transport to the center of the town ... 
And then you want to decide: How are you going to draw the character? 
So whenever you want to look great and competent, reduce your stress or improve your marriage, or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high-quality chocolate without incurring the caloric cost, or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages, or whenever you want to tap into a superpower that will help you and everyone around you live a longer, healthier, happier life, smile. 
Half of her body was stricken, the other half not. 
This is the name of my company, Giving Toys. 
And taking that into the world of climate change -- which is, frankly, the Mt. Everest of all problems -- just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long, just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long, doesn't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on. 
So they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior. 
RISD is kind of my new kind of passion, and I'll tell you a little bit about that. 
But let's move on to Stage Two. 
Now in the last 50 years, we Americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want. We're richer. 
They travel into our airways and infect our lungs. 
Obviously, if you make the step bigger, and if you have obstacles, you need the full control loops and reflexes and everything. 
There's something I'm developing here called social intensity syndrome, which tries to account for why guys really prefer male bonding over female mating. 
That's what I'm here to tell you. 
So, as they finish the surgery, they just swing the microscope over, the tables are placed so that their distance is just right, and then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process, we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon. 
Think of the space that we spend most of our time. 
And Ms. Murrock uses my own "American Born Chinese" with her English 1 students. 
My journey as an artist started from a very, very personal place.

It's also surrounded by many other vital organs, like the liver, the stomach, the bile duct. 
In fact, 11 straight months of savings have happened since the beginning of the crisis. 
We tell the whole story, we explain who the people are, how we feel about them; we spell out all the inside jokes. 
So they invented their own fetal heart rate monitor. 
If you're wondering why the Tarahumara don't fight and don't die of heart disease, why a poor Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive, and why we somehow were able to find food without weapons, perhaps it's because humans, as much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe, actually evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs. 
This map was made for military reasons. 
They're hard to see, and the sky is really big. 
The sound that you're hearing are the actual emission spectrums of these atoms. 
Maybe we'll be lucky and discover some magic thing, but I don't think so. 
If it works for them, it will most probably work for you too. 
It's called "Don't Get All Pole-emical" -- (Laughter) -- and it's in Beekman Hall, and, what else, like, non-Jell-O shots are also available for vegans, and, oh, okay, yeah, totally, yeah, we should also focus on your questions also. 
"Be that as it may, Napoléon introduced a new constitution and a legal code that kept some of the most important achievements of the revolution in tact: freedom of religion abolition of hereditary privilege, and equality before the law for all men." 
So, in fact, we use constructive and deconstructive techniques in everything. 
KT: No, no, I'm just still looking at the road. 
Well, then we moved to London for high school. 
It's constructed. It's created in your brain. 
So, complexity. Now, how many here are jugglers? 
But what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we're working on, and we're just doing these little labors? 
I combined my lab experiments with computer models and discovered that after most giant impacts, the Earth is so hot, there's no surface. 
That creates more opportunity for harmful mutations. 
Purely for the purposes of illustration, let me suggest four more barriers to add to the four that people said blocked the path to communicative civilization. 
In science, research builds upon the work and knowledge of others, or by seeing further, by standing on the shoulders of giants, to paraphrase Newton. 
And then about seven years ago, we had a research student from Australia. 
(Laughter) To learn how and why Whitopias are ticking, I immersed myself for several months apiece in three of them: first, St. George, Utah; second, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; and third, Forsyth County, Georgia. 
What does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us that Europe is putting its money where its mouth is. 
I've talked to them. 
In 1986, I had the presence of mind to stick a music hall on the north end of the building while I was building it. 
And it's really rather better not to mate with yourself. 
A living, breathing comic book series, but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man, these guys can actually do it. 
I mean, who wants to hook their brain up to their computers? 
But we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And the reason it isn't is because everybody's watching television or playing Angry Birds. 
We weren't even here. 
They're on all these different websites and services. 
They used floor mats and saris to understand measurements. 
This is the back of Boston City Hall, the most important, you know, significant civic building in Albany -- excuse me -- in Boston. 
All of a sudden, our principles called for green space preserving the important ecological features. 
So the paradigm isn't exactly working, and I think our policymakers realize that, because in 2012, Mayor Bloomberg signed into law what he called the most ambitious and comprehensive open data legislation in the country. 
We test it by prediction: What is the next word in this ...? 
Now, not so much. 
It was a sports summer camp for four- to six-year-olds. 
"Honey, get the truncated octahedron, we're having guests." 
The military and theater communities are actually very similar. 
But with Baxter it doesn't hurt. 
And in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure of introducing these kids to the world of total freedom, a world consisting of magnificent vistas like these -- everything you see here is obviously in Israel -- as well as close encounters with all sorts of small creatures coming in all sorts of sizes, colors, shapes, forms and so on. 
It's endlessly complex, but somehow familiar, but the patterns kind of repeat, but they never repeat exactly. 
This is a consumer choice problem. 
A typical example being, "Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies." 
Now, this is the normal way it's done. 
And since you think your job is interesting, you say, "I'm a mathematician." (Laughter) And inevitably, during that conversation one of these two phrases come up: A) "I was terrible at math, but it wasn't my fault. 
And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says, "If something exists, it must be possible." 
There's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there. 
Just a few quick before and after shots. 
(Laughter) Now, there's kind of two issues here. 
Before it pops, it will jet tiny droplets of aroma molecules and intensify the flavor of champagne, making us enjoy much more the flavor of champagne. 
TJ: I would still want to know that you could do that and get below zero by the end of the century, in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere, and solve the problem of biodiversity and reduce the impact on land use and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water. 
And that's what Einstein predicted over 100 years ago. 
We'd better get that other seven percent. 
Of course, human groups are nowhere near as cohesive as beehives. 
More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press — (Laughter) (Applause) (Cheers) — these are the attributes that they associated the Kenyan MPs with. But I want to challenge that. 
The failure to account for vulture scavenging can result in forensic scientists inaccurately estimating how long someone has been dead and then searching through the wrong missing person's files. 
Who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked? 
We take people who are fleeing their war-torn country, and we go after them. 
Scenario A wipes out 90 percent of humanity.

And so we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony, TEMPT, and his cause. 
I'm a contemporary artist with a bit of an unexpected background. 
(Laughter) Sorry, that was mean. 
When he was trading fours with me, improvising vs. memorized, his language areas lit up, his Broca's area, in the inferior frontal gyrus on the left. 
Your lungs contract your diaphragm and that creates a self-sustained vibration of your vocal fold, that creates a sound. 
It makes for an exotic and chilly commute. 
AAA: You see, undercover is always a last resort. 
So, we have companies and non-profits and charities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort. 
Innovation is hard, because it means doing something that people don't find very easy, for the most part. 
So what, though, is driving that change? 
So you, you give it everything you got and you wind up on the street. 
Now Danny is currently traveling the world, teaching anatomy to the public via his body paintings, which is why it was so shocking to find out that he was rejected from medical illustration programs. 
And the best part about it is they snap together with magnets. 
That type of orientation fundamentally transforms the way in which we think about water, transforms the way in which we make decisions about how we might protect water, protect it in the way that you would protect your grandmother, your mother, your sister, your aunties. 
A total of six beams, in a perpendicular arrangement, ensure that atoms traveling in all directions will be intercepted. 
I don't know for sure that the Brits invented this particular view of the world, but I suspect we might have done so: we are right in the middle, and we've cut the Pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world. 
And we know what's happened in the past, so if we start now and we look at technologies and improvements to the food system long-term, we might be able to recreate the food system so when I give my next talk and I'm 60 years old, I'll be able to say that it's been a success. 
And I was going to do a thing, I say, "Well, change the copy. 
I've also been going about the business of putting down roots, choosing a partner, making babies. 
How to interact with healthcare providers, when to interact with healthcare providers, how to use medications in ways that work for them. 
Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it, but sometimes they get a little freaked out. 
At this distance, it works immediately. 
So in 2006, I started my first group of grandmothers. 
And as a result, Styrofoam is considered a nonrenewable material, because it is neither feasible nor viable to recycle polystyrene. 
And that is the leading indicator that Google's recovery, if you will, will be in something other than search. 
Nobody knew where the nearest lifesaving AED was to be obtained right now. 
At the beginning of the space exploration age 50 years ago only, the probes we sent in space revealed that the planets in our Solar System constantly bathe in a stream of particles that are coming from the Sun and that we call the solar wind. 
I, of course, and all of us, are very much in charge of these big decisions in our lives. 
I'll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior. 
If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted, that leads to a temperature increase, and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects: the effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects, in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes, and so you get ecosystem collapses. 
Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical. 
Because for us to team up to build the future we know we can create that none of us can do alone, that's the mindset we need. 
Governments in island and coastal nations may want to protect their waters, but often these nations have very high debt and can't afford to prioritize conservation. 
With each passing year, her contributions become more vital: overfishing and habitat destruction have decimated salmon populations, putting the whales at near-constant risk of starvation. 
They were missing the vision. 
One day, I was walking on a street, I saw people selling fish. 
Live life. Thank you. 
There was a recent study that asked Americans, "Do you feel like you're no longer close to anyone?" 
It takes its inspiration in form from life. 
MS: A playful, mindful brand. What is your brand? 
In Oxford, perhaps we can use Lewis Carroll and look in the looking glass that is New York City to try and see our true selves, or perhaps pass through to another world. 
So I've joined a growing band of people that try to make molecular spells using DNA.

Those tries were elaborate. 
If you do it again, you can get arbitrary patterns. 
If you ever go bar-hopping, who do you want to take with you? 
DP: This. 
We've never had that before.

"Headache." 
So, (Japanese) But I didn't say (Japanese). I said, (Japanese). Pretty close. 
A mother finishes setting the table for dinner. 
A lot of change has occurred. 
They all have blond hair, blue eyes. They're happy. 
And I tried, and I made it. 
He says, "They are scientific investigations with real intellectual value."

Is the gift of songwriting taken away as easily as it seems to have been bestowed? 
We have an awful, awful reality right now. 
This isn't about taking certain guns away from all people. 
I don't know; I'm not sure, but that's what I've done all the time. 
However, in other individuals, it's genetic, that is, that it's actually a combination of genes in part with the developmental process that ultimately determines that risk for autism. 
There is not a single sociological study, psychological study, that's ever shown that. 
AB: Multiply 22 times 47, make sure you get 1,034, or the calculators are not working. 
I made it to upstate, and I never left. 
This is from Stanford's Computer Science 101 class, and the students are supposed to color-correct that blurry red image. 
So, we developed a lesson delivery model for instruction that focused on small group instruction, making it possible for all the students to get their individual needs met in the classroom. 
(Applause) You see, it's quantum locking, not levitation. 
I'd like to take you on the epic quest of the Rosetta spacecraft. 
Therefore, you Google their names and in a certain universe, you find this information. 
So imagine someone who's coming out of that world, that late-19th-century world, coming into the country that I grew up in, Ghana, the society that I grew up in, Asante, coming into that world at the turn of the 20th century with this question that made the list: what have they got instead of Christianity? 
And as we speak right now, three million girls in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation. 
I have a tool for understanding this confusing world of ours, a tool that you might not expect: abstract mathematics.

There will still be expensive treatments, huge friction from our insurance system. 
You don't want to just go and crush them with a big claw. 
Now -- that approach of designing something and then covering it with a protective dome we also did for our Mars project. 
I turned the families to face each other. 
Sensation -- it is the way that we first experience love. 
And would this mean there are certain aspects of the universe that lie permanently beyond our comprehension? 
So now we've got this situation, and I think it's time to take stock and to say what were the things that the African countries did right? 
It tells where we have been, who we have met, and in many ways, even what we're thinking about. 
Sixteen percent, by weight, of the interior contains frozen water, or ice. 
Fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention, and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic, to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground, to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment, to crash safety features. 
We encourage them to bring children. 
It's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it. 
We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit. 
But look at how predictable this is. 
Quite extraordinary. 
In the past few years, doctors have discovered probably what is the first truly new antidepressant since the SSRIs, Calypsol, and this drug works very quickly, within a few hours or a day, and it doesn't work on serotonin. 
Some people say the secret to happiness is low expectations. 
They said, "Don't give it to any human," and they gave me a piece of paper which said it was a patent, and from that, we had to figure out a way to make this medicine. 
(Laughter) No, even the good stress can mess with you, but it's the bad stress that I came to talk about. 
And it was a dream. It was a wild dream to perform in an orchestra, to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel, but much more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family, my new musical home. 
But using the term in this way not only fails to fully convey Orwell's message, it actually risks doing precisely what he tried to warn against. 
It was the year I left university. 
It actually happens. 
And so we redesigned chemistry, we redesigned physics. 
GS: Yeah, I think it'll be between economy and business, but you do it in an hour. 
This is an essentially philosophical idea, and it's one that can't be answered with software alone, but I think requires a moment of species-wide, existential reflection. 
What if your wristwatch tracked your mood, or your car sensed that you're tired, or perhaps your fridge knows that you're stressed, so it auto-locks to prevent you from binge eating. (Laughter) I would like that, yeah. 
And here you see me in a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang -- about two million inhabitants. 
But if you say, "I don't care whether he rose from the dead. 
I think I was a stronger baby than my brother. 
They have hotlines and spreadsheets and data. 
So we came up with BirdLasser, which is used by the Kenya Bird Map, and also we have the African Raptor Observations, which is now used by the African Raptor DataBank. 
First rule, a good foundation that keeps the wall dry from the ground, and second rule, a good roof that protects from the top, and third rule, erosion control. 
I think as machines' ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve, it's going to become possible to analyze an entire life's worth of content -- the Tweets, the photos, the videos, the blog posts -- that we're producing in such massive numbers. 
But this is what Crisis Text Line is. 
The good teams stream it in a way that the players can use. 
In six billion years, the sun will look like that. 
Here's what happened. See that line on the very top with the little dots? 
But long-term climate stability is strange, if only because astronomical influences can push a planet towards freezing or frying. 
What's your name? 
and he said, "Hiya, Beth." 
And it's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that, and that's what I'll talk about for 10 minutes, or whatever the time remains. 
Those are hugely important aspects to think about. 
The frustrating answer is we don't really know. 
♫ And that guy, "Seven Years in Tibet," turned out to be a Nazi. ♫ Sweeney: Yeah. 
Space inside our arteries is fully utilized.

Einstein resolved the malleability of time by combining it with space to define space-time, which can bend, but behaves in consistent, predictable ways. 
This is an average, healthy-looking teenage girl receiving this feedback at one of the most emotionally vulnerable times in her life. 
I didn't join the Army because I had a lust or a need to go overseas and fight. 
And you start seeing these networks, this cosmic web of structure forming.

With many, many, many, many face of barbaria. 
This one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing. 
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight.

The winners get the job or a good credit card offer. 
And we've got a production unit in Oxford, or just south of Oxford, where we actually produce these mosquitos. 
As a result of the bus accident, she experienced life-long health complications and endured many hospitalizations. 
That's because she dances. 
You have to force them to bathe. But you can do 15 minutes. 
(Video) Oh, you're crying. You're crying. Gina, you're crying. 
It was humiliating. 
Today we also have progressive lenses which get rid of the line by smoothly varying the focal power from top to bottom. 
And there are three questions I ask myself about everything I do, whether it's running for office or starting a business; when I decided to start the New Georgia Project to register people to vote; or when I started the latest action, Fair Fight Georgia. 
And you could actually find full fossil evidence of these. 
For one thing, it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another, because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling. 
And note what I said: "when," not "if." 
It allows you to set your own criteria for what sort of things you want to look at. 
It took several stages, in fact, starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments. 
Started by a tight-knit Black community near Charleston, South Carolina, the Charleston permeated dance halls where young women suddenly had the freedom to kick their heels and move their legs. 
It's because we were able to run, during the manufacturing process, 20 colors for the X and the O, which is the name of the computer, and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor, you get 20 times 20: you get 400 different options there. 
I'm talking about the robot girlfriend, the dream of one lonely geek in a windowless basement who vowed one day: "I am going to marry my creation." 
(Laughter) But you don't say that, because they're the guys you're targeting. 
And as you start to mess around this way, I think that, in some small ways, you do start to see the landscape of your everyday life a little bit more like something you could express yourself with, and a little bit more like you could participate in designing the future of the way the world works. 
His wild opponent leaps into the air, crashing down onto Gator's rib cage. 
Now shared car services are also springing up around the world, and these efforts, I think, are great.

It's something that, since it was invented a year or two ago, has given me untold happiness. 
But you can see those spikes, and they're there. 
I could be as short as five feet or as tall as I'd like. 
Another technological danger that threatens the future of democracy is the merger of information technology with biotechnology, which might result in the creation of algorithms that know me better than I know myself. 
This is DNA in its classic double helix form. 
You basically need intelligence, you need an ability to sit still and focus, to communicate openly, to be able to listen to people and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be, and those are things that women do extremely well, as we're seeing. 
You wonder if you should walk faster or if you should slow down.

His name is Jomo. 
Now, I live in New Orleans, and I am in love with New Orleans. 
The last minute penalty shot that wins the tournament. 
Small stuff stinks, but, of course, it's essential, right?

It’s an increasingly common sight in hospitals around the world: a nurse measures our height, weight, blood pressure, and attaches a glowing plastic clip to our finger. 
And here's a picture in the icefall; it's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly, and it actually changes every day.

And that is how we obtain understanding. 
One of the things that I think about in my work and my research is optimizing and figuring out where we should put these plants and think about the local resources available -- whether it's land, water, cheap and clean electricity -- because, for instance, you can use clean electricity to split water to produce hydrogen, which is an excellent, carbon-free replacement for natural gas, to supply the heat required. 
I wish I had more wishes but three is what I've got and there they are.

I said, "No, I want to take this woman." 
I only knew what it felt like to be a teenage girl in New York City, not a teenage boy in New Zealand, not a prom queen in Kansas. 
For a phantom traffic jam to form, there must be a lot of cars on the road. 
And you're playing a painful sound. 
You're really a driver or a passenger -- to use a Volkswagen phrase. 
And it reminded me of something that I had just been present for. 
It needs the stomach to create the energy. 
The whole cementation process takes about 24 hours. 
The link between them is often overlooked, but gender equity is a key answer to our planetary challenge. 
I'm here to talk about the wonder and the mystery of conscious minds. 
So for instance, we told some people, "Look, you can buy the sweater, but you can't tell anybody you own it, and you can't resell it." 
And unfortunately, most scripts aren't as easy to dismiss as that one. 
And -- (Applause) And the numbers show the overwhelming agreement among the American public: 90 percent of Americans support expanding Brady background checks to all gun sales -- including 90 percent of Republicans, more than 80 percent of gun owners, more than 70 percent of NRA members. 
Watch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot. 
So the simulated robot has a motion rule, which is how it traverses through the structure, looking for a place to fit in, and it has pattern rules where it looks at groups of blocks to decide whether to place a block. 
At this point, Grace became visibly distressed, and she prodded the body, and she vocalized. 
And there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians, trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown. (Laughter) So, you can just imagine -- right. 
So, we do regenerate, but for limited distances. 
Why do some but not all young children lie? 
So I just really want to share with you a reflection that the future of cities today depends less on buildings and, in fact, depends more on the fundamental reorganization of socioeconomic relations, that the best ideas in the shaping of the city in the future will not come from enclaves of economic power and abundance, but in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity from which an urgent imagination can really inspire us to rethink urban growth today. 
If you take these old surviving cells and compete them, also under starvation conditions, against a new, fast-growing culture of E. coli, the grizzled old tough guys beat out the squeaky clean upstarts every single time. 
(Applause) Helen Walters: Marc, come back in the middle. 
The CD-ROM and then the Internet came along, new technologies made the distribution of knowledge many orders of magnitude cheaper, and the encyclopedia industry collapsed. 
Now before I dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption, I'd like to try and answer the question that every author rightfully gets asked, which is, where did this idea come from? 
And if the answer is no, would you please give me your mayor's phone number, because I need some advice. 
So let me tell you about the evening that I first discovered the ugly truth about introspection. 
Girl: Because she's light-skinned. 
I'm so OK with it. 
So now -- I always ask, why do I put myself in this position? 
(Laughter) You're much more likely to catch the joy of human bonding. 
This is something that I set down, from the very beginning, as a core principle of the community that's completely not debatable. 
Simple awareness is where it begins. 
And one of the reasons for that is because antivirus companies often don't recognize stalkerware as malicious. 
And he would later tell me that it took all of everything he had not to do so. 
This idea was jokingly referred to at the time as the "Big Bang," but as the evidence piled up, the notion and the name actually stuck. 
One is to let the food go in and the other is to let the food go out. 
Well this was really cool. 
And so what I have felt -- and I have looked at this from a national security issue -- when I was Secretary of State, I decided that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy, not just because I'm a feminist, but because I believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered, that values are passed down, the health situation is better, education is better, there is greater economic prosperity. 
We signal the passage of a life with rituals. 
But I got sent to Jerusalem to make a film about early Christianity. 
And what have we just learned in the last few weeks? 
As you probably can't see the detail here, but this is his report card, and you'll see, he's got perfect scores. 
It wants to be chanted out loud, to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue. 
And I just finished a couple of months ago. 
Buoyancy pushes me up to the surface. 
And it's fun for the whole family. 
You know, GDP measures the output of all of our work, but it says nothing about the nature of that work, about whether that work is worthwhile or fulfilling. 
Some of them are obvious, some of them are not so obvious. 
So on January 11, the anniversary of Aaron's death, we began a walk that ended on January 24th, the day that Granny D was born. 
Some science museums have an exhibit which consists of a screen of blue light, allowing you to see these blue sky sprites much more clearly than you normally would. 
But unfortunately, we couldn't get staple crops like grains and rice to grow this way. 
He said he was motivated by -- and I quote -- "The scale of the injustice that the documents would reveal." 
That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand. 
The only way to really achieve all of your dreams is to fully enjoy every step of your journey. 
If I ever get out of here, there will always be a mark by my name. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Okay. 
I want to take the project across the country. 
Biologists term procreative success to mean the age where you have children and then another generation, the age when your children have children. 
In fact, all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating. 
And those groups are, globally, people who sell sex and their more regular partners. 
Also, there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane. 
This is the future that awaits us. 
You can watch the ripples, again, washing over the table, the tomato and the wall in the back. 
I've speculated that bats may see color with their ears. 
Now, here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about: For the last 25 years, oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems. 
The first coil could successfully treat only half of the patients in Bolivia. 
Are you awake? 
Well, I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen only in our five-minute experiment. 
That's the crux, and someday I hope to emblazon that across Times Square in New York and a lot of other places. 
And we have window farms all over the world. 
OK. So -- (Laughter) it's just super helpful feedback. 
So we need to grow. 
When was it that you yourself realized that there might be impending peril for your country? 
It is what you infer about that room. 
Hi. So today, I'd like to share some works in progress. 
Down at the very base of it, there's fiber optics that work better than ours, actually, to move light, but you can tie them in a knot; they're incredibly flexible. 
I'm a physicist by training. 
Look at that picture. 
So it makes sense that women would be getting less funding than men if they're engaging in prevention as opposed to promotion-oriented dialogues. 
People come to the table, and even these very blunt, staged social interactions, and they, and there's just numbers going back and forth between the people, and they bring enormous sensitivities to it. 
By the time he's in third grade, he's got lower math and reading scores. 
In surgery, it’s called “see one, do one, teach one.” But the process is the same, and it’s been the main path to skill around the globe for thousands of years. 
And then Russia, due to its alliance with the Serbs, mobilized its army. 
And yet, look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold. 
And I was like, "All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo, and here we go all over again." 
It's like a mechanical trick. 
It was giving airtime to the issue of sexual assault, opening up discussions amongst friends, amongst families, in the media that had been closed for too long, and stressing that victims shouldn't feel to blame for what happened to them. 
There was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this county, it's all misconduct. 
So you completely print this part, and it can transform into something else. 
So if you say to me, "There was a man named Jesus and he once existed," that's outer truth, right? 
We want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas, and the old people have all the power and decide what science gets done. 
And it's not just beautiful. 
That's the idea. 
He said, "Dear Professor Dweck, I appreciate that your writing is based on solid scientific research, and that's why I decided to put it into practice. 
You can tell he's Scottish because he's wearing a deerstalker cap and Wellington boots. 
We should start making our own connections, fighting for this idea of an equal and globally interconnected world. 
For much of history, the vast majority of language was spoken. 
Who of you grew up in a family business, suffered the torture? Yes, yes. 
What foods did we love then, and what has changed? 
But anonymity basically allows people to say anything, all the rules gone. 
Ten years ago was a seminal trip, where we explored that big iceberg, B-15, the largest iceberg in history, that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf. 
They also have a chaperone with them and will be meeting an aunt at the Porticus of Livia. 
There are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth. 
So, wealth -- how can a bat possibly bring us wealth? 
PM: So after three-quarters of an hour, he recognizes you. 
First: accrue wealth, power and prestige, then lose it. 
We're blind to all frequencies outside that, unless we use instruments to help us. 
We've made a fascinating discovery: there's nothing wrong with the kids that affection and sunshine and food and enthusiasm and Herbie's music can't cure. 
The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads. 
And it would be the size of a small marble. 
I was exploring, at the time, the hyperbole of icons -- and Diana and Marilyn -- and the importance of celebrity in our lives. 
Once the deal is closed, we use the transition fund to protect our parks, giving our government time to increase our own funding gradually until the end of the 15-year period. 
And against the odds, we found a match for her, who turned out to be me. 
But the phonetic approach is also absent today, because when, in the 18th century, we decided how we would standardize our writing, there was another approach which guided a good part of the decisions. 
They also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back. 
"It's funny," I said to myself, "You can mingle with the opposite sex at the holy Kaaba, but not at the Burger King?" 
It's hard to ask for help. 
We've got to show these kids interesting stuff. 
He said, "What is your father's name?" 
Now I'm getting more comfortable in the fact that at some point in the inevitable future, I will die. 
Because there is a better way. 
"Form follows function" had become modernity's ambitious manifesto and detrimental straitjacket, as it liberated architecture from the decorative, but condemned it to utilitarian rigor and restrained purpose. 
It doesn't matter if you fail. 
The Earth can support that if we choose the right path. 
These are tactics the men and women in the United States of America and police forces use every single day. 
We turned heads. 
But over time, my fear of the dark turned to curiosity. 
But the geneticist Professor Steve Jones describes how Unilever actually did solve this problem -- trial and error, variation and selection. 
Her job, her goal and her calling was not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber. 
I'm going to pause there. I'm going to ask you for your courage. 
It might make you wonder: What do we do with dead languages? 
I love what I do, because I learn that we haven't changed. 
A lot has changed, but in that era, girls would rule the playground. 
(Laughter) Let's think about that for a few more minutes, shall we? 
As a surgeon, this is a global issue that bothers me. 
And in my heart, it's most definitely worth trying. 
We get to talk about her emotions and her feelings because we have exclusive time together, and that time is planned time, it's organized around not just my schedule but her mother's. 
The teams that spend money on themselves have the same winning percentages as before. 
We're developing alternative powertrains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word -- economically, socially and environmentally. 
And once I pulled on those god-awful pants and belted them tight, almost instantly, I developed what can only be called a swagger. 
Like, you can feel intense pleasure and some others around you can be suffering a lot. 
It's not because doctors don't get it. 
So let me just end with a couple of scenarios. 
Computers hate clouds because they're simultaneously very large and very small. 
And we get to the receptionist, and we say, "We're here for the lunch." 
Of course, that's not possible. 
How are we going to do these attacks? 
I wanted him to know that each of us is more resilient than we could ever imagine. 
The number is four-thirds. 
I thought stem cells were a good option, but they hadn't developed to a point where I could take advantage of them yet. 
Well, what happened next electrified animal lovers across the world, because Tahlequah refused to let her baby slip off into the water. 
So the idea was, just forget about giving it a new name. 
So here is the world in 2015. 
(Laughter) But then, on a Sunday in June 2017, something beautiful happened. 
She connected with our local organ-procurement organization, the Washington Regional Transplant Community. 
(Laughter) And the amount of cash mattered -- 10 dollars was good, 20 dollars -- even better. 
They will say: "People power will work only if there is a foreign pressure." 
After six months, it was time to go home. 
So again, looking at very, very large data sets, and you saw those full-body scans that we can do. 
In the context of "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi," its mirror image is presented. 
(Laughter) And they consume for more than 40 dollars per day. 
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars. 
I've had Parkinson's for the last 15 years, and this gives me a sense of urgency that I want to do this now, while I feel good enough to really be part of this team. 
So if we take a long-term perspective, we explore. 
The United Nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts; it's called the Peace Building Commission. 
You know, when you're standing up here, you can see all the different people. 
You can see the curve is obviously heavily left-weighted. Here's how heavily: if you take the top 10 percent of photographers contributing to this system, they account for three quarters of the photos taken -- just the top 10 percent most prolific photographers. 
This cannot be." 
My father helped those who resisted dictatorships in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and then it was the turn of Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Mexico. 
Well, let me see, it's a quadrocopter, but what's kind of special about it is there's a leash. 
Then in about the 1930s, with the advent of plate glass, rolled steel and mass production, we were able to make floor-to-ceiling windows and unobstructed views, and with that came the irreversible reliance on mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar-heated spaces. 
Their friends drifted away. 
York had been the King's close advisor and loyal General, but was increasingly sidelined by the Queen, who promoted her favorite supporters, like the Earls of Suffolk and Somerset. 
And there's two possibilities, broadly: Maybe he's doing something wrong, or maybe there's something wrong with the toy. 
And listen, I know, transforming a big city like Detroit to one that is prosperous, one that's functional, one that's healthy, one that's inclusive, one that provides opportunities for all, I know it's tough, I know it's challenging, I know it's hard. 
Interested in what drugs are trending right now on the dark net markets? 
This is a real ad. 
The Academy of Athens, one of Greece's most prestigious institutions, gave her an award of bravery, and she deserves all that praise, and she deserves a second chance. 
It actually turns out, though, even though we've only known of long-range propagation for a few decades, the whales clearly have evolved, over tens of millions of years, a way to exploit this amazing property of the ocean. 
To make the rubbing, they would paint the fish with non-toxic sumi-e ink and print them on rice paper. 
It took as long as the Taj Mahal. 
So the insight is how do you actually reverse engineer this and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material. 
And they would put a number: "Please call this number if you know what's going on in Providencia." 
Was I bored? Was I hungry? 
Eleven doctors died in Sierra Leone of Ebola. 
The director had a vision for this scene based on some wonderful footage of jellyfish in the South Pacific. 
There are so many important issues that we can't talk about. 
And I set about to answer this question because even though many four-year-olds over all of time have probably asked this question, many experts, including myself, didn't know the answer. 
And I get the most amazing fan mail, and I get the most amazing projects, and the biggest moment for me came last Halloween. 
Will the number of children increase each year up to 15 years, or will it continue in the same fast rate and be four billion children up there? 
Matt Mills: Now, what's great about this is, there's no trickery here. 
It's white, black, Hispanic, Asian. 
You see this in junior high a lot. 
Please come for the show." 
It's really, really tiring. 
The baby grew into a girl without freckles, with a crooked smile, who didn’t understand why her friends did not have darkrooms in their houses, who never saw her parents kiss, who never saw them hold hands. 
(Laughter) Anyway, I got married, and I came to the United States, and one of the first jobs that I had demanded from me to speak to small groups of people. 
I think that's going to become completely possible as the amount of data we're producing and technology's ability to understand it both expand exponentially. 
A shocking event plus utopian imagination plus movement muscle, that's how we get a real leap. 
My father learned the magic, spent his time following light. 
She hadn't eaten for days. 
There is Italian Chinese food, where they don't have fortune cookies, so they serve fried gelato. 
I wanted to know their stories. 
People, you can all do that. 
She lived in New York. 
And so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life. 
If you don't get emergency coolant to the fuel in the reactor, it can overheat and melt. 
When I got to the north of Chad, I found a different kind of volcano. 
First it starts with the sexual organs, then it starts with cuss words, then it was Bush slanders and then people actually got to art. 
The good news is that we can change how we build and who we build for. 
But here's the rub. 
No hands at the wheel. 
One image that has haunted me from my early business days is of a grandmother, 70 plus years, being harassed by the bureaucrats in the town planning office. 
Conversation is the most difficult thing in a democracy and also the most important. 
Patient: Triangle. 
There's a similar story, I think, for governments. 
It's a very, very good idea to get them wired. 
Benvolio: "I do but keep the peace; put up thy sword, or manage it to part these men with me." 
Anna and Sanare are the parents. 
Well, that might sound scary. 
Now, in genetics, it's a little counterintuitive. 
And I said, "What if we built a time machine for patients, except instead of going backwards, we go forwards. 
There's over 20,000 species of bees in the world, and they're absolutely gorgeous. 
As a matter of fact, there's one right there. 
Or this machine here, it's from the DIY bio movement, and it's one of the steps that you need in order to process DNA, and again, it's completely open-source from the ground up. 
So with a lot of push and pull and debate, Haryana set itself a goal which said: by 2020, we want 80 percent of our children to be at grade-level knowledge. 
There's so little truth in the popular culture, and it's good to be sure of a few things. 
This is a substantially large impact. 
And I've gone to more than 20 countries in the last few years with "Mating in Captivity," and I asked people, when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner? 
We've seen this story all over the country and even in places beyond the American borders. 
Will they have learned that reading is a chore, a form of piecework to be done for pay, that's the worry, or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake? 
In more turgid prose, but closer to the truth, was the father of modern capitalism, Adam Smith, and he said this. 
How could we support students in exploring all of their desires with these eye-opening experiences and chances to learn from primary sources? 
Someone accomplishing his life-long dream: awesome! 
Over time, the good ones move beyond the four base levels to the fuju [deputy bureau chief] and ju [bureau chief] levels. 
And we can create this economics around that great neglected sphere, the commons. 
Now, I even see a world where editing memories is something of a reality, because we're living in a time where it's possible to pluck questions from the tree of science fiction and to ground them in experimental reality. 
Someone once said that politics is, of course, "showbiz for ugly people." 
And this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity. 
What you'll see is that the rhythms of growth, of vegetation -- a subset of which is food on the continents -- is directly tied to the rhythms of the sea surface temperatures. 
This is fascinating. 
The E.U. also became a currency block, and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world. 
This is it from a distance. 
Do the same thing at work. 
Meanwhile, 90 percent of the large fish, and 80 percent of the coral on Caribbean reefs, is already gone. 
Unger wrote that his results should prompt investigation into other parental beliefs, like the importance of eating spinach. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Of course, Medicaid is funded by tax payers like you, so you might be wondering, "How much does this cost the system?" 
I lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here. 
So it's not just a problem, say, for a global vision. 
And it occurs everywhere -- you know, why bother? 
A few days later, we came out of the back of the low. 
What the Wikipedia articles didn't tell me is that there's liquid water hidden inside the ice sheet, because we didn't know that yet. 
We're at the beginning of a revolution, I hope, in the way we build, because this is the first new way to build a skyscraper in probably 100 years or more. 
Audience: Data. 
What's changed? And of course, it's puberty. 
But to me, things aren't the future. 
We can also buy fewer shoes, wear them for longer, and donate those we no longer need. 
I haven't moved on, and I hate that phrase so much, and I understand why other people do. 
Here's Hellas Basin, a very very different place, geologically. 
Our other partner is East Meets West, an American foundation that distributes that technology to poor hospitals around that region. 
And that's where I'm going to take us now. 
The whole telescope will stand about 43 meters high, and again, being in Rio, some of you have been to see the statue of the giant Christ. 
None of the haikus were written by the same person. 
It would mean that, even before birth, mothers are warning their children that it's a wild world out there, telling them, "Be careful." 
And life as a disabled person is actually somewhat difficult. 
And I am telling you that they're going to do this soon. 
The World Health Organization says that depression is the leading cause of ill health and disability worldwide, affecting 350 million people. 
So this is what happens to me: I have a brand new idea, and immediately I come back to an old one. 
It's kind of like stalking with permission. 
So for patients like Mama Wangari, who have been blind for over 10 years and never seen her grandchildren, for less than 40 dollars, we can restore her eyesight. 
But now imagine that this LED lamp is a street light, and there's fog. 
Like here, in Samboja Lestari, we divide that ring in groups of 20 families. 
He was yet another brilliant design visionary and design activist, who was completely committed to designing a sustainable society in such a forward-thinking way that he started talking about the importance of environmentalism in design in the 1920s. 
Voice 2: Next on the gourmet pet channel, decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer. 
I mean, we thought of these animals as mysterious and terrifying lords of the Arctic. 
And since then, this concern has come up again and again. 
Usain Bolt starts to catch him. 
Actually, we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses even when you're walking around healthy. 
And at this point, by this summer, everybody -- scientists, sports scientists, endurance experts, neurologists, my own team, Bonnie -- said it's impossible. 
Later on, I cofounded the world's single largest civil society campaign for education that is the Global Campaign for Education. 
(Laughter) Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers. 
We've learned -- we don't make promises, we don't do reports. 
While raising two kids, she received a lesson a week in the mail, and practiced. 
Your genes can make you more sensitive to these problems, though they don't write your destiny. 
So here we are, Yuval: New York City, 2017, there's a new president in power, and shock waves rippling around the world. 
So I try to give her the scarf. 
Yeah, I know. 
And when they began on this corner and wrapped around the entire hospital, they were so good at putting these stones together, they asked us if they could take down the original wall and rebuild it. 
We are extraordinary, different, wonderful people. 
And the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues, John King and Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties, is that it seemed to us that across the United States, if you will, tribal councils had convened. 
Now, many of these worries are about basic issues, like what they eat, where they are, who they're with. 
At the age of 18, she completed high school, and she came back to her community. 
I think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great. 
That means you can vent a cache of it from your fuel chamber, and then come back to pick it up again later. 
And what's the difference between being happy and having meaning in life? 
That's bioprocessing, you know; that's bio-assisted technology: using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old, old technology called "domestication." 
Public spaces thrive or fail for many different reasons. 
This is what happened. Now I start the world. 
But even this is not a fair representation of Africa, because it's an average, it's an average speed of reduction in Africa. 
I bought a tractor -- then it broke. 
For example, research shows that after the first couple of years working in a profession, performance usually plateaus. 
The Internet happens to be just the medium in which those people and ideas get connected. 
There is something about physics that has been really bothering me since I was a little kid. 
And I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share, and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going, because it can make a difference. 
I can assure you I was fully conscious while I was taking those pictures. 
The music guides you there. 
And then we have, of course, as any good scientist has to have ... 
If we were willing to slow multitasking down, we might find that it works quite brilliantly. 
(Laughter) But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process. 
Sadly, this ideology of individual choice has prevented us from thinking about social changes. 
His first target was K’awiil, god of sustenance and lightning. 
Because, at a large scale, you can actually make 10,000 times more output per land area than you could -- for instance, if you used soybeans -- if you planted soybeans on that same area of land over a period of a year. 
Now, I have this word taped up in my office: ultracrepidarianism. 
It was a sense, almost, of betrayal, when this little blue dot started at my house, and went running off toward the north leaving me behind. I wasn't moving. 
I wanted to be in motion again to figure out how to unstuck myself and to get back out into the world. 
RM: OK, here we go, OK. 
And there are so many ways that we can form communities like that. 
It is a global telecommunications system. 
I mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers. 
We also have our own unconscious biases. 
Oh, they wanted her bland. 
Experiments with naloxone, which blocks opioid receptors, show us just how essential this opioid-receptor signaling is to social interaction. 
Here's a different shape. 
And these ages of man are still at work today. 
And how others feel about our work certainly isn't. 
But he could see two things. 
Are we evil? 
And I realized he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office. 
The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe. 
You go into the bars in Sardinia, instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar, you see the centenarian of the month calendar. 
Now to make this ecosystem possible, we have to avoid fragmentation. 
(Laughter) One of my favorite writers, Neil Gaiman, put it so beautifully in a commencement address he gave at a university, called "Make Good Art." 
The gas company said, you can have a six-figure sum to move elsewhere and start your lives again, but in return you must promise not to speak of your experience with our company, not to speak of your experience with fracking, not to speak about the health consequences that might have been revealed by a medical examination. 
Now, that movie is set in 2054, about 40 years from now, and as exciting as that technology looks, it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about you, and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect. 
They figured out how it worked. 
And these were traditions of the Middle East medieval traditions. 
And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis, it will create a disc of light that we can control. 
Like, seriously.

This is what it looks like: the people have to tap them twice a day -- just a millimeter slice -- and the only thing you harvest is sugar water, carbon dioxide, rain fall and a little bit of sunshine. 
And the governments say that there are 100,000 families in Britain today like Ella's, struggling to break the cycle of economic, social and environmental deprivation. 
Businesses can go a long way in simply training their workforce about the signs and the red flags of human trafficking. 
You can see Europe is ablaze with updates. 
Do I want to come from a country where the government, in my name, is doing things like that? 
It's going to look like a John Ford Western. 
And it's also ours to lose. 
But I just kept turning myself up until I became Cowboy Gator Magraw! 
Humans and bonobos are the only animals that have sex face-to-face when both of them are alive. 
I was representing the Shanghai Expo. 
A network of balloons in the stratosphere that beam an internet connection down to rural and remote areas of the world. 
The Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption -- it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards -- but it houses 350 chickens. 
But if we're serious about helping more kids from across the board to achieve and make it in this world, we're going to have to realize that our gaps in student outcomes are not so much about achievement as much as they are about opportunity. 
If you're unmarried, that number drops to three. 
Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe. 
Now I should know, because for 13 years of my life, I was involved in an extreme Islamist organization. 
We need a consciousness-raising, coming-out campaign for American atheists. 
About 15 years ago, when I learned of our new-found ability to create quantum effects that don't exist in nature, I was excited. 
(Applause) How do I know that these young people have the potential and the promise to change? 
Now, there are few words to describe the all-consuming feelings of vulnerability, shame, upset and injustice that I was ridden with in that moment and for the weeks to come. 
And I thought, music: that's the perfect place to look at teamwork, coordination, timing, improvisation -- and we just got this robot playing marimba. 
And this is the best we came up with? 
But for all that, it has a lot of holes. 
Their work will constantly change. 
All three planes take off at noon flying west, each fully loaded with 180 kiloliters. 
They always come for you, don't they, your girls? 
So he's got memory. 
Let me show you what that would look like. 
So we've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges. 
So knowing this, and also knowing about the costs and failure of current systems, we designed something new with relationships at its heart. 
Abraham Lincoln realized there was one other ingredient. 
Say you want to have five children, and would like to know the probability of having your dream family of three girls and two boys. 
Other people started to believe in what we were doing, and actually offered us hangar space, donated hangar space to us. And then the Georgetown Airport Authority was bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed. 
Now, there's one problem with it, that inflatables are quite fragile. 
Because where we have a surplus of technology in the cybersecurity industry, we have a definite lack of -- call me old-fashioned -- human intelligence. 
But this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland, and he had the laptop for an afternoon, and I had to take it back. It was hard. 
The huge teacher strikes in the spring of 2019 in Denver and LA -- they were successful because of community support for things like smaller class sizes and getting things into schools like more counselors in addition to teacher pay. 
Which -- it's almost impossible to do in these systems that we don't really fully understand. 
There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War, no politician like John Kennedy who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous, and no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring the solar system. 
Fifty years later, as a tribute, the International Space Station, which is still up there tonight, synced its orbit with Gagarin's orbit, at the exact same time of day, and filmed it, so you can go online and you can watch over 100 minutes of what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride, possibly a lonely one, the first person to ever see such a thing. 
We went in underneath and tapped it, and we found that it had the pH of Drano. 
The problem is the spacecraft's largest diameter is nine feet; ARES is 21-foot wingspan, 17 feet long. 
And they don't say, "It's a killer disease. We're scared of it." 
We mapped the temperatures along the river, and this was by far the most demanding part of the fieldwork. 
Now, those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire 45 minutes on average, and when asked afterward, said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal. 
Let's see if we can use all the tricks of the trade to figure out how to make these drugs work as financial assets. 
That was going to help us end Africa's longest-running war. 
What are the tools that we're actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow? 
So science is done by that demographic. 
I felt a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation. 
Or it could be shaped like a saddle. 
So that's the idea, I think, worth spreading. 
JH: Stuart Brown, thank you very much. 
Hi. So, this chap here, he thinks he can tell you the future. 
I love pretty dances and majestic sculpture as much as the next guy, but give me something else to go with it. 
Of the 30 astronauts in the original Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs, only seven marriages survived. 
But many can be caught by the Chinese police, and repatriated. 
If you accept the reality of the problem, then you must accept that, yes, there is still room in the world for patriotism, there is still room in the world for having special loyalties and obligations towards your own people, towards your own country. 
And if they feel pain, you should empathize with them. 
And he relied on the mathematics of this gentleman here, Évariste Galois. 
So I spent a week trying to learn everything I could about industrial-scale batteries and the electricity grid and renewables and the economics of all of this and whether this was even a feasible proposal. 
He could barely raise his arm, turn his neck. 
Now, meaning is really the underbelly, in some sense, of language. 
Anyway, so I'd like your help in getting that signed up. 
Way too many, of course, but it does mean that every year, there's eight million kids who don't have to die from poverty. 
So all in all, it's possible to do this in large scale. 
"Helps me connect with another person." 
So let's start. Number 10: we lose the will to survive. 
Well, within a year this thing had taken off. 
And he looked at us, and he said, "Mr. and Mrs. Frates, I'm sorry to tell you this, but there's no treatment and there's no cure." 
And so does your [bleep]. These days, with a hair-free back, well-groomed shoulders and an extra optical inch on my [bleep], well, let's just say life has gotten pretty darn cozy. 
My mother said, "Someone has to." 
There are some good points to be made here, things that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning so that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging. 
Not hope in the afterlife, but hope in Africa today, because the faithful are powerful. 
So, next thing you know, I had my bright blue volunteer vest, I had my photo ID, and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss. 
You can make him bipolar, or as someone said, a -- (Laughter) -- you can change his homeostatic drives, or whatever you want to call them. 
And as it became cheaper, bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things. 
Now, this idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until you're the one getting remixed. 
Now, 250 years later, I think we're beginning to glimpse how this is done. 
When I was teaching this Algebra 2 class, I was also working on my master's in education at Cal State East Bay. 
And for the rest of us, when will we start listening to our young people? 
But not everyone looks like a rascal. 
And yet, we need to have that shared sense. 
This is L'Ospedale degli Innocenti, built in 1419 by Brunelleschi, who was one of the most famous and influential architects of his time. 
And this street anatomy is so captivating because it is the furthest removed from the medical world. 
Also, don't delete what you've highlighted. 
I finally decided it was time to take my doctor's advice. 
And we wrote to heads of state, their ambassadors, Nobel Peace laureates, NGOs, faiths, various organizations -- literally wrote to everybody. 
(Laughter) FB: Sherlock Holmes doesn't need a license. 
(Applause) You know that they want to hear you say that you're OK with insults, OK with "lock her up" chants and OK with policy pronouncements with all the sincerity and thoughtfulness that 140 characters can muster. 
We activate communities. 
Again, some of you will know him, most of you won't, Dumas Malone. 
I always had the same high aspirations that they had. 
What's your view on that? 
We don't dismantle, we don't disassemble, we demolish. 
And Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail. 
By this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities. 
Musicians have bigger brains -- it's true. 
These symbols endure because when we look at them, we're looking at mirrors. 
When we were there she was doing a ritual where she reconciles girls, who have run away, with their families. 
And we say that to remind ourselves that children actually have a different physiology than normal adults. 
You operate the world as you operate the real world, which is to say, with your hands. 
So magic is a very introverted field. 
My record was minus 2.5 miles. 
One thousand five hundred US dollars. 
It's fully automated -- you walk towards it, and the seat lifts. 
My mum, born in England, and raised in Nigeria, currently lives in Ghana. 
But one theoretical explanation proposes a wild solution. 
She lost her son on January 19 of this year, and she wrote this me this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with her permission and blessing that I read this to you. 
And regionally, I'm a co-creator of a division within the Department of Emergency Medicine here at Brown University, called Sex and Gender in Emergency Medicine, and we conduct the research to determine the differences between men and women in emergent conditions, like heart disease and stroke and sepsis and substance abuse, but we also believe that education is paramount. 
Health is not just a personal responsibility or phenomenon. 
And, and, and -- there are a lot more animal studies that I could talk about. 
Conservation group gets together, tries to figure out how to breed an animal that's almost extinct. 
I understand that some people don't feel safe talking to their detractors and others feel so marginalized that they justifiably don't feel that they have any empathy to give. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Make sure those values are prosocial. 
So I told my assistant, "Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base." 
People aren't close or distant. 
You need everybody to be involved in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place. 
They know when the water is way too deep, and they're not afraid to ask for advice. 
So the person staring back at us from the other side of the world actually looks quite a lot like you. 
And then if we think about the medications -- common medications that we use, like aspirin. 
For every outskirt that was added, there was another bus route added, running from the outskirt all the way to the city center. 
One of the biggest challenges in doing a DNA extraction is it usually requires very expensive equipment, and takes hours. 
And this, I believe, is the single most powerful way we can reclaim foresight: by seeing ourselves as the good ancestors we long to be, ancestors not just to our own children but to all humanity. 
And her Afghan network was just absolutely everywhere. 
And then everybody at once responds by releasing a poison that will kill the other family. 
But not today. 
We have become totally out of control with the gross idolatry of innovation and of youth. 
As the chant gets louder, I want to respond, but I don't. 
I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data, we never pick and choose data. 
So what we wanted to do is look at this brain-wave component of face detection, the N170, and see if it changed at all as a function of where our participants were paying attention -- to the scene or the face. 
Produce Pete can't believe what we grow. 
So let me tell you how that works. 
Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world. 
Each of us has the capacity to become more adaptable. 
And Stansted, the green alternative, which uses natural light, is a friendly place: you know where you are, you can relate to the outside. 
Together, we can end the secrecy that is currently allowing tax evasion, corruption, money laundering to flourish. 
So let's do that. 
Policymaking is an effort to freeze and perpetuate a particular flow of power. 
I just did a quick search on Twitter about the election and saw two tweets next to each other. 
The African Union has set a goal of 2030 to eliminate malaria from the continent. 
Ocean -- probably the most likely place for life to originate, just as it originated on the Earth. So we would love to explore Europa, to go down through the ice, find out who is swimming around in the ocean, whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters -- whatever there may be that's exciting --- or cephalopods. 
And sometimes we'll catch them on testimonial videos saying such things as, they have more energy after the day to play with their grandchildren, or in one case a guy said, "the Kiva zone is so stress-free that I've actually stopped taking my blood pressure medication." 
It's not that people don't want to act. 
How do you interact with people that are looking for information online, that are starting to toy with an ideology, that are doing those searching identity questions? 
And I started to ask, "Why not me?" 
As I watched people who I knew, loved ones, recover from this devastation, one thing that deeply troubled me was that many of the amputees in the country would not use their prostheses. 
And therefore they're not perceived as a big loss. 
It's pretty annoying for the fishermen. 
We've learned these lessons before in Australia. 
And it goes on. "Well, what triggered you?" 
Then in 2011, we got so far from the sun that if the spacecraft got into trouble, we couldn't actually save the spacecraft anymore, so we went into hibernation. 
He and his colleague, Amos Tversky, spent years researching this disjoint between what people perceive and the reality, the fact that people are actually pretty poor intuitive statisticians. 
So we've made inferences, we've done predictions, now we have to generate actions. 
But what we believe, and what we argue in the book, is that there is no set of rules, no matter how detailed, no matter how specific, no matter how carefully monitored and enforced, there is no set of rules that will get us what we need. 
And so, thousands of Germans met again in the summer of 2018 to talk to someone else with a different opinion. 
And the attraction, the forces, between the molecule and the protein cause the motion. This is a shape-based idea. 
If you focus in on a group like this -- this happens to be a USC game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people, you would in fact see not a single crowd, just like there is not a single crowd here, but you would see these tribes that are then coming together. 
(Laughter) And in an age where we have too many choices, we have very little fear of pregnancy and disease and we've got no feeling of shame for sex before marriage, I think people are taking their time to love. 
And I looked across the table at my African brothers and sisters. 
That was an amazing thing. 
You totally earned them. 
So I'm trying to penetrate that. 
At the heart of every hard drive is a stack of high-speed spinning discs with a recording head flying over each surface. 
I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits, and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see." 
Now, what's important to people at Zappos, these may not be the things that are important to you. 
New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature; the nature of what's happening, showing us our impact on the Earth. 
The next day I was in Tahrir. 
Ten percent of all the money spent on pharmaceutical research is focusing on diseases that account for ninety percent of the global burden of disease. 
This is the big question today. 
And finally number 10, last and certainly not least, Ranjani Shettar, who lives and works here in the state of Karnataka, creates ethereal sculptures and installations that really marry the organic to the industrial, and brings, like Subodh, the local global. 
And I saw my work come alive. 
And in this respect, it's become, like I said, a real blessing for me personally and for my company, because we communicate at a far deeper level, we avoid ambiguities, and most important, my team knows that what they think truly matters. 
So developing nations and first-world nations, imagine if you could take these wild plants and consume them, food miles would basically turn into food feet. 
So that was pretty exciting. 
He purposely did not want these countries to make sense. 
They've called because their pets are unwell, their DVD is broken, they've forgotten how to use their mobile phone, or maybe they are coming out of hospital and they want someone to be there. 
As we and other scientists work to generate the rest of the data that's needed and to learn all that we can from that data, we hope to open many more new fronts. 
GB: I think every religion, every faith, and I'm not just talking here to people of faith or religion -- it has this global ethic at the center of its credo. 
And that's because with all the will in the world, the large-scale engineering infrastructure that we need to roll out rapidly to decarbonize the supply side of our energy system is just simply not going to happen in time. 
Well, thank you so much for sharing this idea, Uri. 
until I realized that the national coach was standing right behind me. 
But Torvalds said, "No, I'm not going to do that." 
And then God says, "Pick it up." 
And so far, 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire, and you can, too. 
(Applause) So, what excites me about cymatics? 
I want you to open your eyes. 
You know, how am I even thinking about doing that, because India is not a small place, it's a huge country. 
And in between those slits were the saddest eyes I've ever seen. 
Imagine if we could create a global network of grandmothers in every major city in the world, who are trained in evidence-based talk therapy, supported through digital platforms, networked. 
An experiment showed that the amount of nurturing a mother rat provides its newborn baby plays a part in determining how that baby responds to stress later in life. 
It's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos. 
You hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected. 
It's not, historically, totally accurate that she's the first programmer, and actually, she did something more amazing. 
Same with this -- it's a movie review. 
And in a way, it's all thanks to him, because he challenged known facts, and with a sweep of his hand, got rid of the theoretical beliefs and all the mental limits that we like to impose on ourselves. 
That's a person down there by the wheel. 
Opportunities are unequally distributed. 
Yeah. So have I. 
It's such a feeling that my love, I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide." 
Mainly as a girl, I learned, as a girl, that anger is an emotion better left entirely unvoiced. 
I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor: intellectual, neuroanatomist. 
Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot, where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words, this pot would just make as much food as you liked, without you having to do any work, provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge. 
But are conservatives happy about this? 
One bottle deposited at home could help extract hundreds around the world. 
What we do in the next step is we release one elephant before the other and that elephant needs to be smart enough to stay there and wait and not pull at the rope -- because if he pulls at the rope, it disappears and the whole test is over. 
So when a plant or an animal cell detects a double-stranded break in its DNA, it can fix that break, either by pasting together the ends of the broken DNA with a little, tiny change in the sequence of that position, or it can repair the break by integrating a new piece of DNA at the site of the cut. 
Refugees in such urban areas don't usually have the right to work. 
"I'm better able to focus on my goals and dreams." 
So this has real implications for reducing the achievement gap. 
We have to speak up. We have to solve this democracy -- this -- We have sclerosis in our democracy. And we have to change that. 
We’re still a long way from understanding all the different causes and interconnected mechanisms of hallucinations. 
So we can think of the Cas9 RNA sentinel complex like a pair of scissors that can cut DNA -- it makes a double-stranded break in the DNA helix. 
Amphetamines. 
But just remember, once you know how to use matrices, you can do pretty much anything. 
Learning is one of life's most essential activities, and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined. 
Over the last decade, a transport-centric, shared economy has connected people across Africa with minivans, auto rickshaws and sedans. 
Girl: I have written two books. (Mother: Was the other one a book or a journal entry?) Girl: No, the other one was a book. (Mother: Oh, okay.) JN: Well this book has seven chapters, and the last chapter is entitled "The Good Things About Being Deaf." 
I want to talk to you briefly about perception. 
The first vision aid was called a reading stone and was invented over 1,000 years ago. 
That was really on my mind. 
You can imagine that that's him writing in English, the same boy who came from the mountain. From a village on Mount Lebanon. 
You don't need to have my grandfather, though you wish you had. 
The reality is a gender fluidity that crosses the entire continuum from male to female. 
And so, if you wanted to control mosquito larvae, it can actually be quite difficult to get them. 
Our world is changing. We live in a different world now, and what were once individual problems are really now global problems for all of us. 
And they were talking for hours about all the topics where they had different opinions. 
This is about a government and a people that care about the rest of the world and have the imagination and the courage to think outwards instead of only thinking selfishly. 
That means it's very difficult to make money from cemeteries. 
It became personal. I was able to go to Africa at one point. 
The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year. The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma, all you have to do is wash your face: no medicine, no pills, no injections. 
Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts. 
But with such low reporting rates, it's fairly unlikely that even repeat perpetrators will be reported, much less anything happen if they are. 
We have a class of experts, professionals, who play very expensive instruments, for the most part, things like the organ, complicated instruments, and if you wanted to hear music in the 18th century, it was live. 
OK, third rule, and I really mean this one: please do not ask for help over email or text. 
As an adult, I learned later that she had been just 19 when she was brought over from Thailand to the States to care for me, on a tourist visa. 
I was in the water taking pictures of surfers, and it started to snow. 
But I know that my husband's family looks forward to the moment when they can ritually display what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives, when they can ritually recount his life's narrative, weaving his story into the history of their community. 
And that is giving enormous headaches to traditional retailers who are only thinking about a few collections a year. 
But he wasn't dismayed. 
That report, in fact, which had all the modern climate science -- the only thing they talked about doing was geo-engineering. 
That's why I'm here with you today, because I believe that one of the many solutions to solving the many water injustices we see in our world today is recognizing that water is a living relation and granting it the legal personhood it deserves. 
(Laughter) It means wearing my pride through my grandmother's tongue, my mother's food, my grandfather's song, my skin etched with stories of falling off donkeys and years and years and years of sleeping under a blanket of stars. 
Now, sleeping is delightful. 
Think back to that three billion people that need a new home, and maybe this is a contributor to reducing. 
JE: Well, that might change a couple things. Thank you. 
If you know how to send a text message, you can get the same information for free. 
You see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor. 
In fact, many people compared it to a war zone. 
Despite all the affiliation events, the celebration, the people initiatives, the leadership development programs to train managers on how to better motivate their teams. 
You also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done, because we'll get the results we've always gotten. 
They are doing it together. 
The war in Vietnam was raging, the Civil Rights movement was under way and pictures had a powerful influence on me. 
And I later found out this is backed up by research. 
You guys remember that? 
More recently, a 6,000 year old crockpot, lined with charred fish and meat, also contained mustard. 
In 1987 I heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river. 
Now, my concern is, we Dems, too often, not so much. 
It's a story that goes on long after his body no longer does. 
I have a lot of it, and that's a good thing I suppose. (Laughter) So this gets really boring and really tiresome for me, so after a while the process of notating is not only boring, but I actually want the notation to be more interesting, and so that's pushed me to do other projects like this one. 
Now all of the babies, even in Berkley, like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli. 
And for the first time, I started to think about how we made decisions. 
When I was a child, I knew I had superpowers. 
(Laughter) I had to have long conversations with my wife. 
A fact came out of MIT, couple of years ago. Ken Hale, who's a linguist, said that of the 6,000 languages spoken on Earth right now, 3,000 aren't spoken by the children. 
And when I went to the refugee camp in Pakistan, there were 7.5 million refugees. 
So, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk, and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus. 
But after three trips to Antarctica, I decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water. 
And the way they represent information is they break up that data into little pieces that are represented by pulses and different neurons. 
And he pulls it towards himself, and he looks down and he starts typing. 
The "Graph'g-Beam Turn On." This next slide, that's the -- as far as I know -- the first digital bitmap display, 1954. 
When I was a little girl, I couldn't show confidence until someone showed me. 
What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it, just like they've cared enough to use Kiva to make those connections. 
This is the Lumière Brothers film that allegedly sent a theater full of people running for their lives as they thought a train was coming toward them. 
What's more beautiful, I thought to myself, this image of a young couple who has just fallen in love or the idea of these two people holding onto this image for decades? 
And as I'm waiting for the ambulance to arrive for over an hour ... 
You can also serve from the kitchen then bring them to the table. 
And yet, we have no energy plan. 
We're going to have to do everything very differently. 
To explain what this means and what this thing is, please let me quickly take a couple of steps back. 
Say, "Computer, would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions. 
I actually want to be able to keep doing AI. 
My research assistant and I mapped places based on how well they delivered on World Bank projects and whether they could get public services to their people, and if you did well on both of those, if you could get sanitation and electricity to your people and deliver vaccines, you were in the upper right-hand quadrant. 
In fact, there's a phone number and an address in Pakistan. 
Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic, just to conform? 
Now, I know it seems really obvious, but when you're having a conversation with someone you suspect of deception, attitude is by far the most overlooked but telling of indicators. 
And the combination of those two is called CRISPR. 
Diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations. 
And I say this, having spent countless hours interviewing global leaders in synbio and also researching their work for science podcasts I create. 
And for all of my growing up I fished on the shores of Connecticut, and these are the creatures that I saw on a regular basis. 
I wanted to go all the way, all the way down the distillery, starting out with a thousand TED Talks. 
When you talk about objects, one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing, and that is gestures: how we manipulate these objects, how we use these objects in everyday life. 
The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study is something that everybody needs to know about. 
I focused on one stroke at a time, staying in between bodies, counting my strokes -- one, two, three, four -- and lifting my head to sight every so often just so I wouldn't get too off track. 
It requires close contact for a message to be sent and received. 
In contrast, three years after Occupy sparked that global conversation about inequality, the policies that fueled it are still in place. 
So he was like my hero. 
The place that is supposed to want you has pushed you out, and no one takes you in. 
Interdependent leaders, on the other hand, want other people to help them, so their announcements are often an invitation for co-creation, and sometimes, they're a call for help. 
When I first saw his picture, I thought that his superpowers came from his super collar. 
What they haven't been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas, or working inside all the time. 
And I need to prove to them that, yes, you can still be married, you can still be a mother, and you can still be respected within the society, but at the same time, that doesn't mean you [should] just be one of the crowd. 
Furthermore, one of the ingredients in vaccines, something called thimerosal, was thought to be what the cause of autism was. 
Today, scientists agree that behaviorism was wrong, and there is underlying, genetically encoded biological machinery for language learning. 
We understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life but our ego hasn't caught up yet. 
And for me and my community, this project was a huge success. 
Here's when the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich -- which I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino -- of course, this being America. 
I became the captain of the team, and that was great. 
We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day. 
In reality, any project is restricted by many factors, such as the cost, what materials you have at your disposal, and unbreakable laws of physics. 
Here, she's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube.

To understand the pace of our own government thinking on this, I like to turn to something aptly named the Worldwide Threat Assessment, where every year the Director of National Intelligence in the US looks at the global threat landscape, and he says, "These are the threats, these are the details, and this is how we rank them." 
Ultimately, we need to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses to really change this culture of ours so that our kids grow up valuing their whole selves, valuing individuality, diversity, inclusion.

Of course, he couldn't have even anticipated the way that his mathematics would be used. 
Now, hopefully, those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that, and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3D structure, and in fact, you know, I can now take a dog, carve it up and then reassemble it so it's a linear string that will fold from a sequence. And now I can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits.

If you need to take in a boarder to help you pay your mortgage or pay your rent, do it. 
It seems to me, there's only one concept that can reconcile those three time scales.

Maxine Greene, who's a wonderful philosopher who's as old as Studs, and was the head of a philosophy -- great, big philosophy kind of an organization -- I went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesn't know, that she still wants to know. 
And yet, there is this disconnect. 
She had gotten better, and not coincidentally, Veronica's home was better too. 
If, if, if, then. 
Student: Thank you, Jamie. 
There's one piece of branding around it that I worry about, which is just that right now, trust-fund kids have a really bad rap. 
She said, "I left my boots -- the very things that I walked in, actually. 
And by the year 2050, there will be 1.5 billion people aged 65 and above. 
So this guy has been transplanting hundreds of mouse heads. 
It wasn't a formal, organized learning process, and I'm happy to admit that. 
This tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words, a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal. 
(Cheers and applause) I did get married. 
In its worst form, the harm we inflict on loved ones shows up as abuse and violence, and relationship abuse is something that one in three women and one in four men will experience in their lifetime. 
So let's do it. So here we go for the first time ever, a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network. 
(Applause) PM: And the doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clinic. 
But I did take it. 
But it is in so many countries. 
I was a college student in engineering. 
Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists, which I so enjoy, and it's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth, to get at the issues quickly and succinctly. 
We feel the problems right now, and have for some time. 
Or, how to deal with a large species like elephants, which may, if their populations get too large, have a negative impact on the ecosystem and on other species. 
But I do this mostly to improve people's lives and well-being. 
There'd be virtually no learning curve. 
You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces. 
The crowning moment of the fellowship is a real project that they designed and built. 
What's really insulting about this is not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data, but when the scan finishes, they tell you in order to clean up the fake viruses, you have to register the product. 
I started to understand where these people's anger was coming from. 
So, one example is from an organization called Rodale. 
I just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills. 
This is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for another machine of his, called the Difference Engine No. 2, which he never built, but which the Science Museum did build in the '80s and '90s. 
Still a big no. 
The change will be drastic. 
One side note on the collection of brains: because of the way that we collect, and because we require consent, we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains. 
When he arrives, there are no opportunities, no jobs, no way forward. 
And when I strap just this little harness, this little wing, I really have the feeling of being a bird. 
And one of the reasons it's so important -- so it's very important to get computers in exams. 
(Applause) The next section here, I'm going to just blast through this, because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides. 
And I believe that teaching kids about equity should be approached in the exact same way. 
So what we're seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about. 
It initially goes quite slowly, you get two or three discrete locations. 
It's not just the children who are affected, though. 
Why not? It is possible. Look around in this room -- all this knowledge, energy, talent and technology. 
And finally, all the energy to make the fusion happen comes from steam-powered pistons, which is way cheaper than lasers or superconducting coils. 
This is where al Qaeda is staged from. 
Basically, it works like this: So, the deeper you go into the earth, the hotter it gets. 
I found these objects both useful and fascinating. 
I think for the most part I've just been kind of putting on a show, but I'm tired of performing. 
And I read it, and it was just -- it was crap. 
My friends, if a wave of 20 million people entering the workforce triggered Niger Delta crisis, Fulani herdsmen crisis and Boko Haram, I ask you: What will four times that number do? 
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way. 
Luckily, the train is going there next, and has just enough reserve fuel for the trip. 
And I actually am amused by them and like them, and think that as a very, very, very, very, very big corporation they actually keep their graphics very nice. 
So, the fashionistas don't really like me because it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it, it looks the same. 
But perhaps the greatest power these creatures had was their appeal to Lovecraft’s contemporaries. 
That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record. 
We've seen this in terms of the G20 usurping very rapidly the position of the G7, or the G8. 
Base editors have been sent more than 6,000 times at the request of more than 1,000 researchers around the globe. 
I had come to completely trust this little blue dot and its reassuring blue halo. 
It is in trying to own the open sea where his greed proves his undoing, when, in a fit of arrogance, he climbs overboard to show that sea who is boss. 
And I decided at that moment that I would spend the rest of my life doing whatever I could to improve their possibilities. 
But in both cases, it turns out that there is also the same remedy for self-restoration, and that is that you have got to find your way back home again as swiftly and smoothly as you can, and if you're wondering what your home is, here's a hint: Your home is whatever in this world you love more than you love yourself. 
To truly understand DNA decision-making, we need to see the process of knot formation in atomic detail. 
The landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine, whether or not someone actually made a mistake, and now, it's for both public and private people. 
For example, as the meeting began, a researcher named Jen rated me a three -- in other words, badly -- (Laughter) for not showing a good balance of open-mindedness and assertiveness. 
Remember, I'm nine years old. 
That's remarkable, but up until now, there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees. 
You might vote for the horsefly or perhaps the wasp, but for many people, the worst offender is by far the mosquito. 
It's a very useful thing. 
I can hardly wait. 
I think we can all agree that it's worth the trouble to do so. 
So for example, "The Cat in the Hat Comes Back," a book that I'm sure we all often return to, like "Moby Dick." 
This is where PCR comes in: it’s widely used to amplify genetic information to large enough quantities that it can be readily observed. 
And just as the train whistle has a higher pitch when it's coming towards you, there's more energy from the gas coming towards us than going away from us. 
We've known about these powerful microbial interactions for thousands of years. 
Because doctors can get what they need instantly, they actually stock less blood at the hospitals. 
You people, the Church of TED, are a very optimistic community. 
And we just closed submissions January 10th, and our final tally was 2,051 videos from 58 different countries. 
It's 13 hours' flight from Moscow. 
We'd become a starfaring species. 
And I've taken the liberty, just for clarity, to translate that to data slices. 
So you have the suburbs and the periphery, you have a center, like a financial district, then the core will be something like the tallest high-rise building in the center. 
But I think this is a mistake, for two main reasons. 
And this pushes innovation in money out to the edges, where it belongs. 
I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know; in fact, I think we know so much, and it's such a reality that we care so deeply, that in fact, what usually stops us is that we're afraid to try and to mess up, because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other's lives. 
I started writing English questions on the blackboard. 
CA: So the new cars being sold right now have eight cameras in them. 
I'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven't learned basic things, like how to be on time -- I was taught that when I was eight years old. 
So don't fear, this is not going to be a cooking demonstration. 
But if it were also the case that these preferences are associated with the different likelihood of producing offspring -- let's say in a ratio of 3:2:1 -- then in the first generation, there would be 3 greens to 2 oranges to 1 red, and in each subsequent generation, the proportion of greens increase, so that in 10 generations, 98 percent of this population has a green preference. 
BL: This bacteria that we've been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found. 
Students and faculty rolled up their sleeves, got their hands dirty and transformed the front into a warm place for people to gather. 
And pretty soon, we began to see changes happening in many areas, precipitated by thousands of people, including many of you here today, and I thank you. 
So the past Christmas, what we did was we asked -- we found 27 mothers of guerrillas, and we asked them to give us pictures of their children, when they only could recognize themselves, so as not to put their lives in danger, and we asked them to give the most motherly message you can get, which is, "Before you were a guerrilla, you were my child, so come home, I'm waiting for you." 
We always hear that texting is a scourge. 
["U.S. Share of Income Going to Labor vs. CEO-to-Worker Compensation Ratio"] Now, higher profit margins do not increase societal wealth. 
It's information. 
We can basically take a picture out of any window on Manhattan and see what that landscape looked like 400 years ago. 
CA: DC appliances. 
And then you get to the bottom. 
That's how I've been trained. 
I discovered a specific type of immune cell, the helper T cell, was present inside that material that I implanted and absolutely critical for wound healing. 
Here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you. 
Now if I were to come to you face-to-face and come this close to you, you would feel threatened. 
They cut out his tongue in mockery of his oratory, and no one knows what they did with his body. 
And we did that originally with Capuchin monkeys. 
It offers many insights. 
So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years. 
Does that ever happen to us? 
We're designing for reuse from the very beginning, because everything does get reused, only now we're planning for it. 
There is no best alternative. 
It's this attitude that we professionals know better. 
They learn English, they learn how to be teachers, they learn computers, and they are my guides. 
But that wasn't my fate. 
Amazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer after receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman, despite the fact that Wikileaks had not been charged, let alone convicted, of any crime. 
"She is kind, gentle, polite, loving, caring, truthful, obedient, respects elders, helps everyone unconditionally, and is good to others and fulfills duty." 
There are still some scientists who would say, hogwash. 
Five years after Tariq died, and for me to complete my journey of forgiveness, I went to see the young man who killed my son. 
It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom and transforms it through ridicule into a different way of seeing and ultimately being in the world. 
Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too." 
We've all done it as parents; we've all done it as children. 
But there was also counter-research going on on the other side, the design of portable drawbridges that you could bring right up to the wall and allow vehicles to drive right over. 
When a chemical signal washes up on one side, it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side, because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment. 
They sing for love, they dance for love, they compose poems and stories about love. 
That means that the beach might have great waves, but it's a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them, even after a great day of surfing, this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve. 
So how can I, as a professor who really cares about her students encourage them to become whistle-blowers, when I know how the world truly feels about them? 
That is my wish, my third wish. 
A bit about my background: I've spent the last two decades inventing, prototype-developing and then shipping billions of dollars of consumer electronics -- with full custom chips -- on the hairy edge of optical physics. 
They stalk blissful couples and study their every move and mannerism. 
And the grim picture in Africa -- I love Africa, and what do we see in Africa? 
Now imagine what you could place in your hands: an apple, maybe your wallet. 
The challenge is to understand the biology of the context of our behaviors, and that's real tough. 
The damage to the lungs leads to oxygen deprivation. 
Earlier in my incarceration, I had received a letter from one of the relatives of my victim, and in that letter, she told me she forgave me, because she realized I was a young child who had been abused and had been through some hardships and just made a series of poor decisions. 
He said, "Why haven't you been returning my calls?" 
So people from Laventille repurposed the old drums left behind into the full chromatic scale: the steel pan. 
Of course, pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. 
But I cannot say, "You think, therefore you are," because "you" are within my perceptual bubble. 
They must know three things: They must have good handwriting, because the data is handwritten; they must be able to read; and they must be able to do multiplication, division, addition and subtraction in their head. 
This routine surgery that many of you have probably experienced, and others are probably the product of, has now become a tragedy. 
You have places you cannot go, thoughts you cannot think, worlds that you can no longer inhabit. 
We do all this to understand the chemistry of one molecule. 
So they could exist even if we don’t detect them over centuries or millennia of measurements. 
Sometimes it's at work, where someone's the boss and someone's the subordinate. 
A lot of this goes back to the work of an anger researcher named Dr. Jerry Deffenbacher, who wrote about this back in 1996 in a book chapter on how to deal with problematic anger. 
You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is, how it can be changed. 
We are on the verge of an AIDS-free generation. 
There's a beautiful statement on the screen that says, "Light creates ambiance, light makes the feel of a space, and light is also the expression of structure." 
But let's accept the strangeness of some of our ideas. 
I love the way that they see the world, because they're seeing the world for the first time. 
Over time, the body starts to develop a tolerance for opioids. 
Come to find out, Kathe's boss, Rita Crundwell, was embezzling money. 
I felt, and I still feel, a lot of distance from the human mainstream. 
This is a crisis that's getting worse day by day. 
So, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe. 
What happens is, these guys start multiplying and they fill up this entire scaffold. 
So, you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu. 
We were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical New York City apartment window. 
Because livestreaming offers that same kind of interactive feeling. 
And we found that there were nine specific things that mattered all across the country and that were the most highly predictive of risk. 
Or skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things. 
The answer is no, but it is possible to get spoiled. 
Once we're prepared to admit that after all, we're not the only beings with personalities, minds and above all feelings, and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet, it really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me. 
Chris, you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug? 
And I reached this formulation. 
We wanted to make a kind of Gothic cathedral around the footprints of the World Trade Center site. 
And only 40 of them are being processed consciously. 
when hate crimes against our communities are at the highest they have been since 9/11. 
Whatever corner of the globe you find homo sapiens in today, you’re likely to find another species nearby: Canis lupus familiaris. 
And to get a feel for why speed is so important in this domain, here's an example of an object detector that takes two seconds to process an image. 
I want a web where I can use healthcare with privacy and where there's a lot of health data, clinical data is available to scientists to do research. 
We actually have universities where people study them, and they get better and better. 
When you ride a bike, I don't really know what, like, my left calf muscle is doing, or how my latissimus dorsi knows to engage when I wobble to the right. 
First they have cleaned the society, then it will be Hyderabad, and soon India. 
There's no such thing, I have to tell you, as absolute safety. 
DM: At the end of these conversations, there's often a moment of reflection. 
So we said, what is -- KA: It was not an inclusive group? 
But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships, with family, with friends, with community. 
But sometimes I feel really lonely. 
Believe it or not, even with internal viscera. 
(Laughter) And then our culture uses language to shape and reinforce these ideas about love. 
This is like you see -- the size of a person over there. 
RM: The design of the Chicago flag has complete buy-in with an entire cross-section of the city. 
Two tribes, Hutu and Tutsi, fought each other. 
And I suppose I'm arguing that we should learn a little bit about what's happening in tragic art. 
They carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations, and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability. 
The Bail Project, by bailing out 160,000 people over the next five years, will become one of the largest non-governmental decarcerations of Americans in history. 
Let me go one step further. 
We're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk. 
(Applause) When we wanted to build our second yogurt plant, Idaho was on nobody's radar screen. 
But what we're going to do, is we're going to create a program for people outside the field of cancer to get together with doctors who really know about cancer and work out different programs of research." 
Now, this is great, I can potentially print my meds based on me, instead of taking six pills. 
You would never, ever design a rocket like that." 
Every year, thousands of cochlear implants, diabetic pumps, pacemakers and defibrillators are being implanted in people. 
I say no, and all three branches of the American government say no as well. 
"Mudbound" was Oscar-nominated, it's a great, very intensive film. 
Migrants send money home for food, for buying necessities, for building houses, for funding education, for funding healthcare for the elderly, for business investments for friends and family. 
But also the earning potential of these children is cut in half in their lifetime due to the stunting that happens in early years. 
Well, to not do so would mean needing to engineer endless acres of land on an entirely new planet by releasing trillions of gallons of atmospheric gasses and then constructing a giant glass dome to contain it all. 
So I wanted to tell a story that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book, and it's a story of something that happened 3,000 years ago, when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy. 
Sharks with wings. 
You scroll down in this profile and you can see all of his prescription drugs, but more than that, in the new version, I can look at this interactively. 
We make thousands of them all the time, and yet, language is getting in there and fussing even with these tiny little perceptual decisions that we make. 
That'll be the end of Moore's Law, but it won't be the end of the exponential growth of computing, because chips are flat. 
(Laughter) One of the things I did just before 9/11 -- August of 2001 -- I took my son, Dax, who was 16 at the time, and I took him to Pakistan. 
I grew up in an enormously traditional family. 
But I was interested to see what reaction we might get by gamifying the data in the way that we have, by using animation and playing on the fact that people have their own preconceptions. 
Now, this is heresy in the design world. 
About this time, I looked all around the circle I was in, and all the kids had stopped playing and they were all looking at me. 
But I persisted. 
But it's not a data point at that one moment in time. 
They were afraid of embarrassing themselves, of looking stupid. 
If I push even harder, I'll go through the bone structure, especially close to the ear where the bone is very soft. 
But what exactly does that term mean? 
This is actually quite meaningful to me, because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole -- we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art. 
some rocks are twins separated at birth. 
And it's like a dial on human nature. 
For the last 28 years, I've been documenting indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents, and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit. 
The two humans got it right. 
(Laughter) If we consider that there are two ways to communicate in the world, and the first one is when you take us on a journey, a magnificent journey that has twists and turns and mystery and drama, until you ultimately get to the point, and some of the best communicators in the world communicate just like this. 
(Laughter) Now for those of you who are highly agreeable, or maybe slightly Canadian, you get this right away. 
For students, it's quite an experience, but for a school, it could be very difficult or expensive to maintain. 
Centuries later, the philosopher Rene Descartes proposed that the universe was a series of whirlpools, which he called vortices, and that each star was at the center of a whirlpool. 
Soap operas teach us to push away doubt and believe in our capacity for bravery, vulnerability, adaptability and resilience. 
"Who hates you?" 
Well, how often do people's minds wander? 
Gasoline costs are a tremendous drain on the American economy, but they're also a drain on individual families and it's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher. 
Well, it's easy to see that our dog really loves us, easy to see, right, what's going on in that fuzzy little head. 
DNA analysis, one of the hallmarks of the scientific revolution of the last 400 years that he started, was the way we found which set of bones actually belonged to the person who read all those astronomical books which were filled with leftover hair that was Copernicus' hair -- obviously not many other people bothered to read these books later on. 
There's something else that is interesting. 
I could talk to you about it right now if I wanted to, because it unlocked it. 
We've already seen, since the start of COVID in early March, a 40 percent increase in our volume. 
You have done your bit. 
Passion about the change we want to see in the world, and clarity that we are able to help chart the course. 
Anyone who wants to see the sunlight clearly needs to wipe his eyes first. 
I grew up with the sounds of war -- the staccato sounds of gunfire, the wrenching booms of explosions, ominous drones of jets flying overhead and the wailing warning sounds of sirens. 
In the United States, currently, we are exploring what might happen if Facebook and others are regulated. 
And even if you don't know East Palo Alto, you might know the story of eastside disparity, whether it's the separation of the railroad tracks in East Pittsburgh or the Grosse Pointe Gate in East Detroit or East St. Louis, East Oakland, East Philly. 
They grow in the rainy season and they've got a seed to help them survive the rest of the year. 
Well, congratulations, you guys are the inaugural members of the Asteroids Club, which is a club for all Americans who are willing to admit that the other side actually might have a point. 
(Laughter) So after the experiment, the two of us just left the room without saying anything. 
We want them to see that protecting health systems and other critical social institutions is an integral part of their mission. 
While I can no longer remember what that argument was about, I very clearly remember how I felt watching him leave. 
Well, there are lots of reasons. 
When a CMU prisoner has a visit, the rest of the prison is on lockdown. 
My first love ... 
Well, it is with such simple questions in mind that I started to make films 10 years ago, first with a friend, Christophe Abric. 
It's knowing how the nongendered Cherokee language enabled Ahyoka's acceptance as a trans woman in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. 
But as I said earlier, this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases, and it ought to. 
We also need skilled operators to come to the rescue and that means constant training. 
Who is that person? 
It's a bit odd, because I'm an economist. 
And we can't conceive of dreaming in both dimensions at the same time. 
Now, Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution, when all of life and our economy was being reinvented. 
She's managed to save the prosciutto, but in the process she loses the tablecloth, which you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner. 
First of all, I have to say I'm not from around here. 
CA: Ed, there was a story broken in the Washington Post, again from your data. 
Right, the current wants to run through the play-dough, not through that LED. 
This is what's called -- I think the technical term might be -- "delivering compassionate truth bombs." 
By then, I will, in the best case, not even have lived half of my life. 
Is it really a border on the map? 
And it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you soon. 
I didn't know he was abusing me. 
In primitive caveman terms, stress can make you fight for your life, or run for your life, if, for example, you're confronted by a hungry saber-tooth tiger. 
That's the building. 
We've looked at our government oversight. 
(Laughter) But in all seriousness, this principle does work, but this has gone too far. 
Neither am I a veteran social worker. 
Thank you so much. (TBP: You bet, Chris. Thank you.) (Applause) 
Here's the product being built. 
By "play" I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dying or that we mandate any particular way of dying. 
The last "A" is Authenticity. 
Childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war! 
EM: Yeah, so we've been sort of puttering around with the Hyperloop stuff for a while. 
If you compare, for example, the number of engineers that those same Asian countries had a couple of decades ago when they were industrializing, we fall far short. 
He fired. Nothing happened. 
This is the Big Crunch. 
And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy. 
Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause) 
For his efforts, Mr. Bihi has been ostracized by the leadership of the Abubakar As-Saddique Islamic Center, with which he used to have good relations. 
So there are two options: intelligent design, direct and indirect -- so God, or my friend. 
He was the control. 
And I had these folders open in front of me with this, you know, hieroglyphics -- let's be honest. 
And humor is a good way, I think, to address serious issues. 
Birds witnessed the emergence of flowering plants. 
So I'm looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday. 
We took the English story and translated it to Russian. 
This clearly was helping people. 
Part of my job is to figure out how and why we want to remove the bubbles from the ink that my company produces. 
And that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems doesn't know what to do with data. 
Blah blah blah blah, blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah. 
The sloth, on the other hand, can reach a leisurely 17 feet a minute with the wind behind it. 
And he ran around the bases. 
Today, that means access to an MRI scanner within an hour or two of a stroke. 
It's the combination of the invisible gases that envelop the Earth, attracted by the Earth's gravitational pull. 
You should be symptomatic for Alzheimer's. 
These are worms. 
Money creates the ability to buy results and to buy almost any other kind of power. 
(Laughter) I've always wanted to say that in this country. 
Of course, you and I know that Coke is the better choice. 
(Applause) But let's try to imagine this. 
2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries over a 20-month period between 2015 and 2016. 
What really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people. 
It's unproductive. 
And so I had to divide it up into multiple panels that are 10 feet tall by 25 feet wide. 
So I went to work for NASA. 
I could say, "Imagine a jellyfish waltzing in a library while thinking about quantum mechanics." 
(Laughter) How did we get here? 
When I say "human trafficking," most of you probably don't think about someone like my auntie. 
This is an incredibly devastating weapon. 
The R D piece -- it's crazy how little it's funded. 
How do we make ourselves aware of our own unconscious bias? 
Suppose next that there are zero people in the room. 
It has to get very compelling before we'll pay attention. 
So it wasn't actually until over 40 years later, in the 1970s, when scientists realized that CFCs would break down high in the atmosphere and damage the ozone layer. 
He's the commanding officer of the entire Bruin Battalion. 
When nails first appeared in the fossil record around 55.8 million years ago, claws had already been present for over 260 million years in the ancestors of mammals and reptiles. 
might be answered by studying these systems. 
JC: Right. Now is there anything you don't do? 
We are trying to shoot lasers into the brain. 
As I turned to walk away from the shrine, I drank in the warm summer air, and I watched an eagle turn lazy circles high above. 
The first was that I grew up with no religion at all. 
They had one camel left over. 
So what do you call being impacted by multiple forces and then abandoned to fend for yourself? 
And if you want to read the full correspondence and the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company, you can see that written up in this week's edition of PLOS Medicine. 
CS: It's been the most wonderful thing for my migraine. 
And 80 percent of those killings were of trans women of color. 
And to the Peruvian government, it's just another stretch of unprotected land ready for development. 
When we hear stories, should we be more suspicious? 
We need to stop buying the lie that these images tell us. 
Hezbollah offers all of these services and more. 
And we wanted to make it possible to study the brain not as a cellular smoothie but as a cellular fruit salad, in which one could generate data about and learn from each individual piece of fruit. 
And today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination of cesium-137. 
It tanks so fast that I'm about -- I'm exactly 30 years into my career, and the chance that I will publish a paper that would have a higher impact than anything that I did before is less than one percent. 
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me -- let's call him Lex Luther -- (Laughter) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog. 
Some things worked, some things didn't. 
It has polar caps. It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours, so it has weather. So, it's very similar to some extent, and you can see some of the features on it, like the Grand Canyon on Mars, or what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars. 
And companies that actually define a true north, things that are nonnegotiable whether times are good, bad, ugly -- doesn't matter. 
And despite my fear of ever being looked at for too long, I was fascinated by the idea of spoken-word poetry. 
Data can be grouped and divided in any number of ways, and overall numbers may sometimes give a more accurate picture than data divided into misleading or arbitrary categories. 
So I brought my whole cabinet, and we met with all of the pooh-bahs of little Greenville -- the mayor, the city manager, the head of the community college -- and we basically emptied our pockets and put all of our chips on the table, incentives, you name it, to convince Electrolux to stay, and as we made our pile of chips, we slid them across the table to the management of Electrolux. 
We need these last wild places to reconnect with who we really are. 
Imagine your normal, everyday commuter-newspaper-reading ritual. 
Well I do as I always do. 
Incentivize them. 
And they said, "Blue, blue, we love blue. Let's do it blue." 
We were about 100 miles off the coast of Russia: 50-foot seas, big waves, green water coming over the wheelhouse, right? 
Decades later, it turned out that the source of their blindness was most likely some sort of bacterial infection. 
At Bovingdons, the operations director was interacting with five technologies. 
But that's a pretty extreme situation. 
Now imagine millions of sweat bees choking the air around you, flesh-eating bacteria, the constant threat of a landmine going off or an unseen hippo capsizing your mokoro. 
So we're going to fly down to the Amazon River basin, and here again we have a big river system that is draining and moving and plowing material from the Andean Mountains, transporting it across South America and dumping it out into the Atlantic Ocean. 
Why are doors so often rectangular? 
Throw it into the audience again. 
It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3, and play it on your very same computer. 
(Laughter) One girl named Mary said, "You asked my mother?" 
And there's this loud thumping on the door after about 45 minutes in all this, and people were shouting in Korean. 
Virtually every species that has been studied to date is impacted by light pollution. 
This plot shows two members of a pair. 
AYGTK: Mary Talbert successfully demands that the Negro Exhibit come to the fair. 
And yet from everything we've been talking about -- compliance, or addiction, or weight loss -- we now know that community is important, and yet it's one thing we don't actually bring in. 
She studies 12 hours a day for three years to prepare. 
(Applause) This data is also making the world better because I'm sitting on the world's first map of real-time crises. 
These are volcanic stones laid by hand. 
Many worked in camp facilities or taught in poorly equipped classrooms, while others raised crops and animals. 
People are like, "OK, if you don't do aid, I'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?" 
This machine over here is actually two separate two-propeller flying machines. 
Thanks. 
Fifty years on from Watson's accidental encounter with the Sun, Jansky's careful listening ushered in a new age of space exploration: the radio astronomy age. 
I traveled all across the country seeking answers to the question that I often got myself from the skeptical outsider: What, you mean China is doing something on the environment? 
This time I paid 25 cents because I thought the task was a bit harder. 
When I set out to make the film, I expected it would be a simple story of perpetrators and victims. 
Many may not think of cats as serviceable sailors, or cooperative companions of any kind. 
I imagine what can be said with them. 
But time is running out. 
In fact, don't ask just any kindergarten teacher, ask an experienced one. 
But it felt weird to me that I knew more about local Kenyan politics than the politics of my own hometown. 
This is because time doesn't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one. 
This comes out. This comes out. 
We take earth's materials, make them into stuff we want, use it for a while, often only once, and then throw it away, and that is pushing us over planetary boundaries, so we need to bend those arrows around, create economies that work with and within the cycles of the living world, so that resources are never used up but used again and again, economies that run on sunlight, where waste from one process is food for the next. 
And as "These Birds Walk" played at film festivals and theaters internationally, I finally had my feet planted at home in New York, and with all the extra time and still no real money, my wife tasked me to cook more for us. 
But she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling so she can count, and won't be cheated when she reaches the market. 
About 170 milliseconds after we show our research participants a face on the screen, we see a very reliable, detectable brain signature. 
There are some great resources out there. 
The AMI is a method to connect nerves within the residuum to an external, bionic prosthesis. 
Here's how you do it: you take a jar and you fill it up, about halfway, with water. 
So what could we do to ensure that also those babies who are not breastfed could restore their microbiota development after encountering those disruptive early life events that might disrupt their gut microbiota development? 
So Jude said, "Okay, I'll do some statements for you." 
Sincerely yours, a fellow citizen. 
But people want to be religious, and religion should be made to be a force for harmony in the world, which it can and should be -- because of the Golden Rule. 
Maybe, after a period of practice, you can dispense with the mirror, unlearn the paralysis, and start moving your paralyzed arm, and then, relieve yourself of pain." 
[Company sold to Facebook, June 18, 2012...] There are other companies that will place a camera like this — this has nothing to do with Facebook — they take your picture, they tie it to the social media, they figure out you really like to wear black dresses, so maybe the person in the store comes up and says, "Hey, we've got five black dresses that would just look great on you." 
Foods like caffeine and peppermint contain ingredients that may have a relaxing affect on the LES, which makes it incapable of doing its job. 
She said, "I burned a letter and two postcards." 
And if you have a liquid hot mass, it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum. 
And, you know, people would always ask James Watson -- he's not always the most politically correct guy ... 
That doesn't mean you need to spend any more time to see more. 
So, there's another picture. Here, this one. I really do like this picture. 
We took data from over 20,000 employees around the world, and we found the answer was simple: respect. 
Now let's talk about sex. 
And when you've found the one you like, you vote. 
I'll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn't standard for male or female. 
Well, option one is oftentimes the easier route. 
When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully, because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent, for the people and for yourselves. 
And that's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period. 
I can see from your face that you're having some problems with this. 
And what has happened? 
Now, Negroponte has been right about a lot of things. 
So we started to reach out to local groups, community agencies, and even the Ohio State University. 
It's called "Fashion Statement," and there are quotes about fashion, so you can read it, and also, because the definition of artist book is very generous. 
Because this is the ultimate selfie. 
And it feels historic. It tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary. 
(Applause and cheers) This was a groundbreaking moment for Oregon students. 
I had a good job. 
But that being said, we just as easily could have lost one of the oldest living things on the planet, and the full impact of that disaster is still yet to be seen. 
And the education system will need to evolve to ensure students are equipped with the right skills. 
And you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out because they have no brushes, for a dollar. 
Well, mass timber panels, these new products that we're using, are much like the log. 
And now, the power imbalance is established, because we have agreed to our personal information being gathered and used on a scale we could never imagine. 
Interfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years. 
For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive. 
I have that in me that can convert poverty to riches, adversity to prosperity. 
And we've had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms that were funded by the U.S. military, using these prototypes, that had up to 10 different degrees of freedom including movable hands. 
You act compassionately as though you have compassion: grind your teeth, take all the support system. 
I've not had a fight with my wife in two years. 
We have wonderful music, and a great music school. 
You don't need to dig down for these chemicals, and we can do things much more efficiently. 
And he said to me — I remember this like yesterday — he was a great guy, but he said to me, "Kid, go to school, or go open a falafel stand. 
And as you'll probably have picked up from Maryam's blurb, I'm not a nun, either. 
So they're absolutely essential. 
So what used to take a factory full of workers working by hand in this little box in New York, she's able to have effectively — She doesn't actually have to go to Shenzhen to do this manufacturing. 
(Applause) My seizures are greatly reduced, from two to three times a day, to sometimes two to three times in one year. 
It's actually Bitcoin. 
It's not Japanese. 
Now, I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running [behind]. I want to show you quickly what I've created, some new type of illusions. I've done something with taking the Pixar-type illusions. So you see these kids the same size here, running down the hall. The two table tops of the same size. 
Now for me, Kiva is just the beginning. 
Somebody's mum has heard that Sophie's dad is in prison. 
See, when you get close they're really just blobs of paint. 
Instead of every leader responding to what’s happening in their jurisdiction, here everyone must treat the world as the giant interconnected system it is. 
It would not be government by public opinion poll. 
Well, I was introduced as the former Governor of Michigan, but actually I'm a scientist. 
It was a whirlwind, to say the least. 
In the same time, the number of for-profits that crossed it is 46,136. 
Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from 1990 for the next 20 years. 
And that quote, "The only disability in life is a bad attitude," the reason that that's bullshit is because it's just not true, because of the social model of disability. 
So it can be much safer than a driver assistance system can ever be. 
Here we see a 10,000-ton ship will deliver 1,300 tons to Saturn and back -- essentially, a five-year trip. 
For one-third of the population, looking at a book while moving along in a car or a boat or train or plane quickly makes them sick to their stomach. 
He wasn't alone when he started. 
And by the way, that coffee, that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs, actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters. 
And then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture. 
One of the leaders I met with early on said to me, "Linda, I don't read books on leadership. 
You know, whether you agree with, you know, legacy or not, we are actually leaving behind digital traces all the time. 
That was the one that I studied. 
(Laughter) But it's when you put all of these elements together -- when you get the viral appeal of a great joke with a powerful punchline that's crafted from honesty and integrity, it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation. 
In fact, neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior, things like paranoia, delusions and hallucinations, these are patternicities. 
So, I started taking art courses, and I found a way to make sculpture that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands, with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system. 
When I became interested in these questions about 10 years ago, scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of. 
He's like, "Good stuff, man. Colombian. Top of the line." 
Everything that we need to make an atmosphere on Mars, and to make a livable planet on Mars, is probably there. 
Are we providing the software? 
And so today, I would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents. 
This is an audience of entrepreneurs, of doers, of innovators. 
Igniting, igniting, igniting fire. Igniting fire. 
But the point is to say, when we talk about saving people, or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100, we're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi. 
We found this incredible false door, mostly intact. 
And now he sells cool drinks, he's by the highway. 
Which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter, which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies. 
That's another thing that can be done. 
The biggest thing that's invisible to us is what we don't know. 
I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development, if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society. 
I looked a lot like an orangutan, our close cousins, or the Incredible Hulk. 
Our idea of death develops as we grow older. 
Would it surprise you? 
However, union jobs are on the steep decline, and it's time for us to start calling on our unions to really bring all of their financial and political capital to bear in the creation of new, union, living-wage jobs in our communities. 
This first of the two strategies is like a hunter, exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry, who finds other quarries along the way. 
It's not even AI. 
Why should we care? 
For example, the calculation: can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall? 
We all have living rooms and kitchens, bedrooms and baths, and there are nine of these homes around a central courtyard. 
So there you have it: the evolution of a headline. 
It can design the machine that can build the machine that can do any physical work, powered by sunlight, more or less for the cost of raw materials. 
It's a common metaphor: "Life is a journey." Right? 
If so, more warming is in the pipeline. 
One example of this has been the One Laptop per Child. 
So the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light. 
Mayors are usually from the places they govern. 
So the production side is working. 
And often, the community would come together to contribute money to send a neighbor's child to school -- not only in the country but to universities abroad as well. 
It's called "Security Blanket." 
We didn't realize that he was going to show up there, so kudos to you guys for arranging a nice surprise like that. 
We got to walk through his climate-controlled server room. 
Just two years later, I started working at the place that made those films, Pixar Animation Studios. 
Refugee return, which the United Nations High Commission for Refugees thought would be extremely unlikely, has largely happened. 
And all forms of intervention need support, the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth, the kinds of institutions that increase productivity. 
You had to live, did live, from habit that became instinct, in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard and except in darkness every movement scrutinized." 
If the inflationary consequences of using SDRs in this way are benign, it could be used to justify the additional, extra issuance of SDRs, say, every five years, again, with the commitment that developed-market countries would direct their share of the new reserves to the Green Climate Fund. 
So we party and dance to their music. 
Or, we decide that we're going to prevent dementia, and it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us. 
And he'd gotten used to it. 
The number of people with actual doomsday buttons has stayed fairly stable since then. 
Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump. 
SL: I could do without things like cockroaches and snakes. 
As it slowly dies, it could leave its mother vulnerable to infection, and all the time, it may be emitting hormonal signals that disrupt her tissues. 
And one time we caught a live one. 
I meet so many of these parents; it's the most heartbreaking part of my job. 
We're so clever we can overcome all of these seeming biological impediments. 
When I was a kid, I learned to swim in this lake and I climbed mountains every day after school. 
I didn't save all of them, because I didn't realize at the beginning that it would be something that I would want to keep track of. 
Now, it turns out research tells us that solving is as primal as eating and sleeping. 
This is when the two superpowers were fighting a war by proxy, along the periphery of the sphere of influence, fully funding arms organizations. 
So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation, then it makes sense for us to have electric cars as the mode of transport. 
CA: But not everyone who has this disease has been so fortunate. 
But if this is the case, in our own cat's eyes, who are we? 
Compared to drug-resistant TB treatment, it's actually easier. 
Sadly, you're going to have to go back to Google and start your shopping search all over again, but you didn't get ripped off, so that's only a good thing. 
Let me tell you how this works. 
It was interesting to me that those other people were folks who were more senior than the folks that were being discussed and they theoretically had had some interaction with those candidates. 
But only five minutes later, he forgot the test had even taken place. 
I think it's very important, because right now somebody needs to step up, and this generation of veterans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance. 
And this is the time when Project Tiger emerged. 
Just imagine how different the refugee crisis could look if more countries made this possible. 
Some scientists have even estimated that phages are the most abundant organism on our planet. 
And that's just the point, to capture the best days and nights, to abolish limitations, to have your default answer be "yes" and your default question be, "Why not?" 
And then you changed away from that. 
And so this really shifts the human/plant dynamic, because a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time. 
If you close your eyes right now in this room, you're aware of the size of the room from the reverberation and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces; you're aware of how many people are around you, because of the micro-noises you're receiving. 
China exports business people, nannies, students, teachers to teach Chinese around the region, to intermarry and to occupy ever greater commanding heights of the economies. 
One of the fascinating things about what we were working on is that we were seeing, using new scanning technologies, things that had never been seen before. 
So in fact, these species didn't move at all. 
And each one sees different threats to the country. 
Oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group at the expense of other groups. 
So, what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health. 
Call me crazy! (Laughter) ["Useful mystery"] All right. 
(Laughter) I didn't know where to begin, but I said yes. 
And when academics have done studies like this of corporations in the United States, what they find is 85 percent of people say yes. 
This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley, California, where I did my PhD on why we're better in games than we are in real life. 
Because what the data shows, above all else, is one thing, which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. 
Second of all, it's really beautifully balanced: it holds well, it feels well. 
I had never seen an Internet. 
You can build nice stations. 
Have you ever had any diseases? 
(Laughter) But I think this is why I have dedicated my life to promoting citizen video to expose human rights violations, because I believe in the power of video to create undeniable truths. 
We have to pretend. 
They also learn how to advocate for their point of view. 
It's extraordinary. 
We're not going to be just another family that abandon that." 
Change is possible. 
Oh, yay! You are all awesome. 
Everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of Brazil nuts because we would buy it otherwise. 
It's kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape. 
They generate milliwatts, or microwatts. 
There are a lot of things going on in that sense. 
The war on talent, the need to attract people at all skill ranges, to push us around in our wheelchairs, but also to drive our economies. Our innovation will be vital. 
Crazy idea today. 
Well, you wouldn't want this lesson to stop just because a cloud passed over the panel on your roof. 
I'd come home from my lessons completely wiped out mentally. 
He is splendidly attired in his 68,000-dollar uniform, befitting the role of the French Academy as legislating the correct usage in French and perpetuating the language. 
And so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility, something that we call "compartmentalized flexibility." 
Compassion has many faces. 
Perhaps they're using this as a way to see each other, quickly find each other, mate, go back into their hole for the next long stint of time. 
This is an iron, you know, for your clothes, to which I added a spraying mechanism, so you fill up the vial with your favorite scent, and your clothes will smell nicer, but hopefully it should also make the ironing experience more enjoyable. 
I profoundly believe this is avoidable. 
This is my art. 
Magdalene's son Basil was one of over 20 people who were shot, drowned or presumed dead in that land grab. 
And I never really got that, until one day, I was in the grocery store, and I wanted to buy an apple, but I couldn't buy one apple. 
They go places, do challenges, earn points. 
That's true of prostitution, but it's also true of agricultural work, hospitality work and domestic work. 
They set limits on discards. 
And I'm coloring these small windows blue if another virus shares an identical sequence in its genome to that virus. 
This is where it all comes from, and where these farmers who actually, ten thousand years ago, put us on the road of bread. 
And a group of engineers worked in Germany, and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what's the successor to the SUV. 
We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data. 
I wanted to make an idea meritocracy. 
And Paul and I were in the same program. 
The cement industry generates around eight percent of global CO2 emissions. 
Geet Sethi: When a city gives to the children, in the future the children will give back to the city. 
We not only share pieces of the world that we have seen but also parts of our day-to-day experiences. 
This guerrilla -- and the main group is the FARC guerrillas, Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- they have financed their war by kidnapping, by extortion, by getting into the drug trade, by illegal mining. 
I came here to give you a science lesson about animal mating systems and why defining monogamy has been a challenge for scientists. 
In 2008, Burhan Hassan, age 17, boarded a flight from Minneapolis to the Horn of Africa. 
And now this brain takes care over this, to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface and, of course, digest our food we cook. 
The example on your left side is IP-mapping, a computer-generated map of IP addresses; again -- servers, machines. 
But in fact, they come from a 10th-century Arabic book called "The Encyclopedia of Pleasure," which covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia, and everything in between. 
Let's secure the future for ourselves, our children and their children. 
You have fragments of other shells. You have olivine. 
(Laughter) Now, I put the laser here, and -- now, when I deal the cards in the laser, I know where they are but -- yes? 
It's just that these days, us adults seem reluctant to allow ourselves the indulgence of just allowing our imaginations to drift along in the breeze, and I think that's a pity. 
The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves? 
He found that if people see the justice system as a legitimate authority to impose rules and regulations, they would follow them. 
So, this guy comes with me. 
As for Ebola, there is absolutely no market at all, so the only reason we have two vaccines in late-stage clinical trials now, is actually because of a somewhat misguided fear. 
In the ancient world there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences, and there was a very healthy sense of caution, reflected in the Tree of Knowledge, in Pandora's Box, and especially in the myth of Prometheus that's been so important in recent metaphors about technology. 
When nation-states default on their national sovereignty, cities have to step up. 
And it is critical that you actually handwrite your letter. 
We've collected it from 2.9 million face videos, people who have agreed to share their emotions with us, and from 75 countries around the world. 
And Tajfel rejected this. 
They didn't focus on all that was wrong with my kid. 
So there are thousands of different species of phytoplankton, come in all different shapes and sizes, all roughly less than the width of a human hair. 
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being English, or Chinese? 
And they already had a six-legged robot called LEMUR. 
So I'm not against fear. 
How many of you in here have some experience living in a mud house? 
Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far? 
Antibiotics were only allowed when a veterinarian determined the animal was sick. 
Escaped fish can even disrupt local ecosystems as invasive species. 
Well, the way I met Harriet is an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary, exponentially growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness -- from low-cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bioinformatics to the connection of the Internet and social networking. 
It alerts them to our various emotional states, and it can even tell them when someone is pregnant or sick. 
How did the water freeze if the air temperature is above freezing? 
I call this turbo-urbanization, and it's one of the key drivers of fragility. 
And juxtaposed against this grid, you see actually, by rolling over each individual one, the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process. 
And I was astonished, I was very angry, and I was deeply confused. 
And you don't see any fish. 
I went to see my mother the other day, and she told me this story that I'd completely forgotten about how, when we were driving together, she would pull the car over, and by the time she had gotten out of the car, and gone around the car to let me out of the car, I would have already gotten out of the car and pretended to have died. 
Mau is a palu, a navigator priest. 
AF: That's in the Philippines, and you know, there's a lot of rivers, ladies and gentlemen, which look exactly like that. 
But as we decode their natural sounds, we're also planning to put those back into the computerized system. 
If you take a group of people with the right equity incentives and organize them in a startup, you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible. 
Come join us. 
And the more candidly I spoke, the more I was asked to speak. 
And it's not because it goes fast. 
So the next process was then to animate her. 
(Laughter) Back in those days, before even Julia, back in those days, there was no philosophy of food. 
So you say, yeah, well, what are really the chances of this happening? 
So if I could control how you spend your attention, if I could maybe steal your attention through a distraction. 
It doesn't count if it was you, sir. 
I went on this process of trying to figure out why, what's happening in the veteran community, why are these things going on. 
So I have a couple of really important questions for you. 
So, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions, as you can see. 
It's a win-win solution. 
And my first step in this direction was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury while offering well-controlled experimental conditions. 
Now the orthodox reaction, of course, is raising the minimum wage costs jobs. Right? 
I only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day than anyone in the 4,000-year history of the plant. 
As doctors learn how to test patients and understand certain tumor genetic types, they can help us determine which patients can benefit from this strategy and which gene blockers we can use. 
(Laughter) The conditions that cause us to define certain neighborhoods as slums can be effectively improved, but not without recognizing the humanity and the agency of the people living in them. 
I tell my students, "If you have a deceptive cadence, raise your eyebrows, and everybody will know." 
I flew home, I'm on the flight with my little black book and I took, you know, pages and pages of notes about it. 
And look, I know, it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation. 
It is evolving into what I call a Pax Asiana, a peace among Southeast Asian nations. 
So the fact that we not only see atmospheric escape on our own planet but we can study it elsewhere and send spacecraft allows us to learn about the past of planets but also about planets in general and Earth's future. 
Home cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes. 
And they taught me a lot about restructuring the road. 
But Don Quixote is unstoppable. 
And the reason for this is, firstly, because the state in China is given a very special -- it enjoys a very special significance as the representative, the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization, of the civilization-state. 
We incorporated brain breaks throughout the day, allowing kids to sing songs, do yoga poses and participate in structured physical activities. 
Look at the world. 
Three years later, we have 16 million data points, we have designed our own Geiger counters that you can download the designs and plug it into the network. 
Take a look at this picture. 
Well, unfortunately for the guys, men actually didn't play differently, but there was the perception that they did. 
The other idea is for supportive staff to be on hand to help families with the care and preparation of loved ones' bodies. 
Where climate activists used to talk about changing light bulbs, now we're pushing for 100 percent of our energy to come from the sun, wind and waves, and to do it fast. 
Which I'd never, really -- they had never, really, thought about but, now, they think about it. 
It was security. It was protecting information. 
How do I make that happen?"

There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other." 
Well, we got 331, which is okay, but we also know that not a lot of guerrillas saw them, but we know that a lot of guerrillas heard about them, and we know this because we are constantly talking to demobilized guerrillas. 
They're going to speak the Web language. 
But these college girls had a completely different view of their future. 
These stories show us that we can all be part of a future where fishing cats and the lost mangrove forests are protected and restored by fishermen themselves, creating carbon sinks that can help offset our ecological footprints. 
So here's to another day at the office. 
And that's where the technological stars have really aligned to help us.

And we've just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads, and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate. 
But we have to own up to our moral responsibility to judgment, and use algorithms within that framework, not as a means to abdicate and outsource our responsibilities to one another as human to human. 
It's a different shape, but other than that, it's the same basic limitation. 
So what that means is, one could use computational methods to read all of the books in a click of a button.

We have a new organization together called The Institute for Figuring, which is a little organization we started to promote, to do projects about the aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics. 
But this time, I was the patient. 
And I think that human beings right now need a change, and the only change to be made is a personal level change. 
(Laughter) And sometimes we need — (Applause) Sometimes we need excuses to do nothing.

(Laughter) So there are lots of things that we're still working on, but one thing I have learned is that bamboo will treat you well if you use it right. 
It's also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds. 
86 percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons. That means 86 percent of the stuff we're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff. And there's a role in here for conservation. There's a role in here for alternative stuff, but we've also got to get that other portion right. 
And so that year, I started to build this robot, Kismet, the world's first social robot. 
As a result of this, I formed a campaign, Who's My Doctor? 
He's not crazy. He doesn't miss getting shot at and seeing his friends get killed. 
Negotiable meaning that it makes a difference whether you do something or not. 
And on the other end of the spectrum, this is a microstructure. 
And the neat thing about it is, to fly it, there's no joysticks, nothing like this. 
So this was designed by my Head of Engineering. 
It might surprise you. 
Elephant on an orange line, underneath a yellow circle, meaning sun. 
That's not fighting -- that's performance art. 
Now this is something that's been known for quite a while. 
It's missing that savage beauty of experiencing that very thing in the wild for yourself, unmediated by a screen. 
And I knocked on the door and Eun-Sook answered the door, and her eyes were bloodshot, and she seemed to be in shock. 
And Mercer County wasn't alone. 
This was something called an opt-in poll, which means anyone could have found it on the internet and completed it. 
I was, I believe, ecologically bored. 
For me it was a new discovery. 
So something obviously happened between here and here. 
They've graded them, and they've published them for everyone to see. 
And I was doing a project there about happiness, interviewing a lot of local people. 
It's realizing you can't have that child you now want, or you can't give your child a sibling. 
Since there was nothing there, you might as well not look. 
And while I thought everything was perfect, my team -- which was basically my friends and neighbors at that time -- thought everything was going so well, we had no idea a big opposition was coming to us. 
For me, the process is very important, because I'm inventing machines, but I'm also inventing tools to make machines, and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning. 
It's grown-ups that get really upset. 
And it doesn't matter to me whether you're running a coffee shop or you're an intellectual, or you're in business, or you're flying hot air balloons. 
(Applause) TM: Bravo. 
This process happens thousands of times a day without us knowing it. 
And there's a name for people like Davinia: global citizens. 
There's also a growing body of research showing that people who experience more discrimination are more likely to have poor health. 
So I walked away in my trainers, but I left my boots there." 
I was at a meeting recently in Los Angeles of -- they're called alternative education programs. 
Now, what you're seeing is the intensified camera's view under red light, and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here. 
Black is beautiful, but it takes a lot to believe so once society says otherwise. 
We can use it from one patient to the next. 
What happens to education? 
In the morning, the stranger began to dig the foundations at an astonishing speed, and at nightfall he set off towards the mountains to obtain the building stones. 
From the smallest wisp of air to the powerful forces of nature's storms. 
Right, class. (Laughter) (Applause) So these next two modules are also circa 2016. 
That's particularly true of oral sex, which teenagers consider to be less intimate than intercourse. 
After the Opium Wars, Chinese breeds were brought to England and crossed with local chickens. 
The universal nature of beauty is changing even as we're changing the universe. 
Work is gone, a traditional way of life has gone, and it's no wonder that people are furious about that. 
The other thing it does is tells us something about energy policy. 
But here's the interesting thing, the really deep change: over time, the friendships that have formed have begun to replace the practical offer. 
This maps the large cabling in the brain. 
You might get lucky within the first few tries. 
The bridge became known as "Galloping Gertie" because she -- she? 
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them, and with those therapies, we get them to live, on average, to their fifth birthday. 
It's like cutting a cake except this cake is about whale deep. 
They didn't triple their sales with advertising; they tripled it by doing something remarkable. 
And so, he went forth to the people and he said, "I've made this wonderful finding: it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution, and by doing so we could save ourselves 300 million dollars a year, and we could spend that on our children in other ways." 
Maybe tell them about that." 
And I continued to develop it in my daily life to this day. 
We've got airplanes, highway lanes, interior design and horoscope signs. 
And everything began well until the power went out. 
And so, when you study it, you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world. 
And I said to her, "Are you just doing this all the time?" 
Okay, so the bad news first: For every major stressful life experience, like financial difficulties or family crisis, that increased the risk of dying by 30 percent. 
Oh, not so lucky. 
Never before have we in the west been so scrutinized. 
The data scientists would brag about how great and how accurate their model would be, and they'd be right. 
We forged ahead. 
Today, we’ve classified headaches into two camps— primary headaches and secondary headaches. 
I got the easy part. 
It could be a certificate, a contract, real world objects, even personal identifiable information. 
Beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance, so to speak. 
It's happening. 
Poetry does that. 
You can also see that his visual cortex is activated in the back of the head, because that's where he's seeing, he's seeing his own brain. 
So I was thinking, this station that's hated by so many people has to be doing something right. 
Eventually, after our long journey, my family and I were reunited in South Korea. 
Being testable doesn’t mean these vaccines will be successful. 
These communities did not grow up in isolation. 
Hi. 
And this difficult-to-track variable is why most professionals promote reliable long term investing over trying to make quick cash. 
And it would build a working alliance with you through that dialogue. 
And John Doerr and Brook and others got concerned, [unclear], and we started looking around at what the world was doing about being prepared for a pandemic. And we saw a lot of gaps. 
That allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency. 
This is what the US Congress and the National Cancer Institute declared just a few years ago, in 2003. 
(Applause) ... because that story allows those of us who make it to believe we deserve it, and by implication, those who don't make it don't deserve it. 
Your digestion shuts down to maximize the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to muscles and vital organs, so you get dry mouth, butterflies. 
And so we measured the size of the optic nerve using the scans with David Miller three times -- 12 months, six months, and before the infusion -- and you can see the gently declining red line. 
That's why these methods require a prescription from a doctor. 
This one obviously was made out of half a Starbucks cup with a stamp and my home address written on the other side. 
(Applause) (Music) Marco Tempest: When asked about deception, he said this: Announcer: Magic is the only honest profession. 
I see you, see, I'm not the only one. 
And what's more exciting than just turning what's currently in the computer physical is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities. 
Right? "Fantastic Voyage," Isaac Asimov. 
And for the economists out there, you may be interested to know I actually made a pretty predictable income, which was shocking to me, given I had no regular customers, but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday, 90 bucks on a Friday. 
They were never seen again. 
Now, I have very thin hair, so my hair is approximately 40,000 nanometers in diameter. 
What is plotted here is metabolic rate -- how much energy you need per day to stay alive -- versus your weight, your mass, for all of us bunch of organisms. 
And in the landscape of Thomas Jefferson, it's a strange thing. 
So that's what I did. 
And really, this gets to the very problem with these surveillance features, or backdoors. 
One of these is scratch-off masterpieces. 
And then there are modified devices, which are also called "mods." 
(Laughter) But I had the presence of mind to give the teachers' classes that I cut the pottery that I made, (Laughter) and they gave me passing grades. 
Audience: 987. 
I'm just so used to that story. 
Many of those stars have planets orbiting them. 
It was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world. 
They were looking for one way to treat all of us. 
But what if what you're looking at is just half a picture, but there is a city within the city. 
Everyone just has a piece of the care. 
The hate mail I get is unbelievable. 
We've only detected them indirectly. 
But if we want a self-driving car, we need a technology curve that looks like this. 
I'm Kelli Anderson. 
Then you saw what that device looked like, that the woman was using to fix her migraines? 
Or maybe you could pretend to malfunction, and then when the programmers open you up to see what went wrong with you, they look at the source code -- Bam! -- the manipulation can take place. 
His team have been making detailed calculations of the relative impacts of different energy sources. 
No jealous king, no "Arabian Nights." 
All of this sounds amazing, but these aren't just ideas, they're real today, and these lie at the forefront of the circular economy. 
On the big day, you wait nervously as your teacher hands it out. 
This immense region was populated by nomadic tribes whose lives centered on horses, archery, and warfare. 
It's amazing. 
AdG: In persuading them. 
There are over a hundred of different HMO structures, and nowadays we are able to synthesize some of them also in the lab, and that enables us to package them up with probiotics for children and infants who are not able to receive them from breast milk to restore their microbiota after encountering disruptive early life events. 
(Laughter) The public school system of this country was built, bought and paid for using commerce generated from the slave trade and slave labor. 
We didn't have the Andes as our site, but after nine years, that's exactly where we ended up, the lines of the temple set against nothing but pure nature, and you turn around and you get nothing but the city below you, and inside, a view in all directions, radiating gardens from each of the alcoves, radiating paths. 
"He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become." 
in which case they might reject it and not come to a deal. 
All you need to do is get up close and personal, and see the hidden hand of man in the chisel marks left by the tools that built them. 
The other possibility in science, and it's only temporarily changing our automatic assumptions, but one thing we know is that if you take a white person who is odious that you know, and stick it up next to a person of color, a black person, who is fabulous, then that sometimes actually causes us to disassociate too. 
That's what they had all their lives. 
Okay, now if you want to play, I want you to stand up, okay? 
Hospital readiness is critical. 
When people say nothing can change, just stop and think what the world was like 10, 20, 50, 100 years ago. 
Put them in the trash can. It ruins nature when you do this." 
Such life. Right? 
Now, NEOWISE was not designed to find asteroids. 
For most of human history, life expectancy at birth was around 30. 
We recognized kids had rights, we banned child labor, we focused on education instead, and school became a child's new work. 
It has just begun." 
And nobody was listening then, but now people are beginning to listen because there's a pressing, technological problem that we face. 
And so was Darwin. 
Making a three-category list reminds us that there should be something in all three categories. 
And Robert and Jane Meyerhoff, philanthropists, said, "We'd like to help." 
(Beat) Bulletproof chest heaving, my heart beating right through it in a Morse code for: "Fuck with me just once come on just try." 
I hope I've opened your eyes, if you'll excuse the visual pun, (Laughter) to some of pollen's secrets. 
Now, this cosmic knowledge-based view may -- and, I think, ought to -- make us feel very special. 
We know how to do this better, and it's time to do better. 
And the Christmas Day bomber almost succeeded in attacking the United States of America. 
It's a very important period -- it's roughly half the period when we've been fully modern humans on the planet. 
How else to explain the cultural space occupied by Sarah Palin? 
You were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero. 
Of course, every organization would love to be on the top of such a list. 
Meanwhile, in New York City, the NYPD has driven police cars equipped with license plate readers past mosques in order to figure out who is attending. 
(Laughter) That's from a source population the size of metropolitan Atlanta. 
And again, what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see. 
We know this because trying to find a place to live is an example of an optimal stopping problem. 
Because effectively, what's happening here, what's creating this page, obviously -- and we all know this, but it's worth just thinking about it -- is not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson, but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it, and Google just sitting there and running the numbers. 
And they changed the atmosphere. 
(Sighs) Supermarkets as well. 
So I get off the machine, and I'm walking across my living room floor, and I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down. 
Renewables are no longer a fringe activity. 
The future of personal robotics is happening today, and it's going to depend on small, agile robots like Romo and the creativity of people like yourselves. 
And if we think of that -- let me put the picture up -- the fibers represent vulnerability. 
What is going on with men? 
But that doesn't mean there isn't common ground. 
BF: I think that's the next session. 
Islamophobia, for instance, is now a term. 
We have an 11-year-old son; his name is Lincoln. 
They want to know, what's going on in this new box? 
Correction: I should say "smart enough," because who you marry is your own choice, and you'd better marry someone supportive if you plan to have a long career. 
They'd be doing everything that we had taught them. 
You get a beautiful representation of what's going on in the climate system, where each and every one of those emergent patterns that you can see, the swirls in the Southern Ocean, the tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico, and there's two more that are going to pop up in the Pacific at any point now, those rivers of atmospheric water, all of those are emergent properties that come from the interactions of all of those small-scale processes I mentioned. 
And this difference in time between the two is the early detection, the early warning we can get, about an impending epidemic in the human population. 
My colleagues' action was not the only death threat I have received, but it was the most dangerous one. 
That's right; in just a few minutes, a pattern involving millions of neurons is being teleported into 1,200 minds, just by people listening to a voice and watching a face. 
Do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter? 
It's huge and slow-moving -- think gigatons and centuries. 
And Tony said to me, "Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar? 
(Laughter) Loving only our opponents is self-loathing. 
(Laughter) And I naturalized as a citizen. 
Every region has something to offer, and if you created a competition, it respects the states and it respects federalism. 
Now I'm super lucky to be in a place where I can be there for my little brother so that he feels confident and prepared to take on whatever he chooses to do next. 
Well, there are a few ways to influence the extent and effectiveness of memory retention. 
Otherwise that would introduce bias. 
Other people will do that for you -- don't do it to yourself, don't bet against yourself, and take risks." 
Now, what will happen? What if they come to, you know, suck up our oceans for the hydrogen? 
(Laughter) So this was extremely embarrassing. 
Look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time. 
Many male journalists in my society, they want to cover a story about drug addiction in my country. 
We are lying on the floor together, and our bodies are so weak, we are waiting to die." 
But what you'll notice about all of these products is they're very, very intricate. 
And there are these guys who used to model the future of interest rates, and all that kind of stuff. 
Are they going to be around in 50 years? 
And so texting actually is evidence of a balancing act that young people are using today, not consciously, of course, but it's an expansion of their linguistic repertoire. 
And I want to tell you how this gun can help. 
But is that really the case? 
Because those letters mattered so much to me, because writing and receiving and having that communication with those folks so hugely impacted my life, I decided to share the opportunity with some friends of mine who were also inside with me. 
So to begin to answer these questions, we did a research study. 
These things were well-known. 
"What are you doing?" 
With every year, machines surpass humans in more and more activities we once thought only we were capable of. 
Because autistic or not, the differences that we have -- We've got a gift! Everyone's got a gift inside of us, and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential. 
It's a choice. 
Watch years pass, people come and go, while I do life without parole. 
Imagine being able to make perfect lenses. 
Our oceans are pretty much unexplored and undersampled, and today, we still know more about other planets than our own. 
I distinctly -- nobody forgets cod liver oil. 
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging. 
And so, what can you learn from these devices? 
Netflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD in a way that the video-rental stores couldn't. 
And unless you've been on Mars recently, you know there's a lot of that out there. 
The code comes out to be a fairly simple alphabet, four letters: A, T, C and G. 
It took us 30 years to get from the introduction of the personal computer to the level of cybercrime we have today, but looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly, and knowing criminals and terrorists as I do, we may get there a lot faster with biocrime in the future. 
Now DNA exonerated Frederick and it also implicated another man who was serving time in prison. 
And so the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they're critical for our kids and our future. 
And this is the largest project he has got in here, the poorest country in the world. 
No offense to my father, but that's what you get for calling me a "ham" wherever you go. 
These are the people that you can call on for a loan if you need money suddenly, who will call the doctor if you're not feeling well or who will take you to the hospital, or who will sit with you if you're having an existential crisis, if you're in despair. 
Know it in your heart, and make your own mold for what beauty is. 
You need the social stuff there. 
Big, big problem. 
Two: when things get difficult or painful, try to stay open. 
Christiane Amanpour, thank you so much. That was great. 
Or better: How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself? 
You know, the Grammy committee says that if your song contains some kind of pre-written or pre-existing music, you're ineligible for song of the year. 
(Laughter) "So, can you change the design and put it on my forehead, so I can, you know, do this and eliminate my phantom fingers?" 
These are groups of teenage girls who have taken on Web logs, bulletin boards, other kinds of cooperative infrastructure, and have used it to set up support groups for remaining anorexic by choice. 
And this leads to the wonderful irony that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating. 
But ultimately, the story has a happy ending for Sudhir, who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country. 
And so, Anuj and Acumen have been talking about testing the private sector, because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that, look, in a country like Tanzania, 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day. 
Banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3. 
Those neutrons hit the wall of the machine. 
Scenes of forest destruction, forest harvesting and forest fragmentation, thereby making that intact tapestry of the canopy unable to function in the marvelous ways that it has when it is not disturbed by humans. 
And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff. 
The police are called in to physically remove the women. 
So, I'm going to take us back to 2007. 
They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter and then have a really long lens, and we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting. 
We're just seeing the last few pages of each chapter. 
What have they ever done for me?" 
It's a scraper bike; it's called -- from Oakland. 
My mother was devastated, and she couldn't imagine her world without him in it. 
This isn't "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind." 
The real questions is: How can we do both better? 
Another group of scientists believe that the reflex is retained in us today because it actually provides an important advantage. 
Well guess what, they look you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth. 
Telephones were wiretapped, including the phone of the German chancellor in the West, and often also the apartments. 
More hopeful are people we call system-changers. 
Now, given the sorts of challenges I'm up against, it's crucial that I not only predict but also design protections for the unexpected. 
(Laughter) Yeah, right. 
And this particular cave was Lechuguilla, and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans. 
He felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape. 
What percentage of infected people were killed by it? 
I'm 57; still have the check. 
Pause the video now to figure it out for yourself. 
It's going to take the civil rights litigators, the community organizers, the academics, the media, the philanthropists, the students, the singers, the poets, and, of course, the voices and efforts of those who are impacted by this system. 
One of them is right near Boston, called Tewksbury Hospital. 
But what about after technology improves and diffuses and thousands of life science grad students are enabled? 
They're in the back of our body. 
And the policymakers who sit on top of them are, I suggest, simply not thinking about how those facilities could be used to underpin a whole new era of markets. 
It is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant right next to an amusement park ... 
So if you imagine this day when all around the world, you have theaters and places where we project films. 
So if were able to attach one of their satellites to the roof of this theater in Oxford, we could take a picture of a football, clearly, on the pitch at the stadium in Amsterdam. 
This was a huge leap, because Babbage is there saying, "We could compute these amazing functions and print out tables of numbers and draw graphs," — (Laughter) — and Lovelace is there and she says, "Look, this thing could even compose music if you told it a representation of music numerically." 
So imagine -- let's suppose we're doing it. 
CA: A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress. 
Living amongst our tunas -- our North American tunas -- are European tunas that go back to the Med. 
And there's research showing that political prejudices are deeper and stronger than race prejudices in the country now. 
And all of our contributors, who are an amazing collection of people around the world, do their own embellishments. 
(Laughter) Sorry but not sorry. 
But Lizzie Wolf has shown that when we frame our strong emotions as passion, the condemnation of our crying disappears for both men and women. 
This plan was embraced by the larger-than-life Pope Julius II, a man who was unafraid of Michelangelo's brazen genius. 
Before the first iPhone even hit the shelf, the Russian government understood the risks and the opportunity that technology provided and the inter-communication and instant communication it provided us. 
And it goes over here? 
We look at it every single day." 
What if we had an African television network that broadcast diverse African stories all over the world? 
And on the day I met my father for the first time, I was rejected from the Rhode Island School of Design, my one and only choice for college. 
PV: As -- WG: "I don't want to hug you." 
We talk about this a lot, and I thought about trying to give an example of this. So, just one example: Madame de Gaulle, the wife of the French president, was famously asked once, "What do you most desire?" 
And it changed from a state that we would define as habitable, because the three requirements for life were present long ago. 
Before we knew it, we were being contacted from people all over, surprised to see the data out there and released. 
I'm tired of having to do that. 
We reward confidence in some people and we punish confidence in others, and all the while far too many people are walking around every single day without it. 
One of the things that people are so excited about is the fact that it's got autopilot. 
And empathy, it turns out, is a key ingredient in getting these conversations off the ground, but it can feel very vulnerable to be empathizing with someone you profoundly disagree with. 
A bit like inflation: you over-issue currency, you get what you see, declining prices. 
It draws people in so that they can explore and learn together in a social way. 
It also has a very low carbon footprint. 
This is what I spoke about in the last TED. 
They are cells in dishes and animal testing. 
Consciousness is the ability to feel things, to feel joy and sadness and boredom and pain and so forth. 
Syrians have experienced the prosperity of open trade and sustainable communities. 
It goes like this: 163 people across four separate tests. 
So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen. 
And that's why you're not going to have a great career. 
And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result. 
If you don't go into that area and you don't fail, you are actually repeating yourself over and over again. 
So it would work as well, for example, in a power plant or in an automobile factory. 
I had done all I possibly could, and now I was in their hands. 
And quitting is getting easier, thanks to a growing arsenal of tools. 
Now, I remember when I first told my wife about this new business model. 
Best Buy, the consumer electronics company, gets all its employees -- the cleaners, the shop assistants, the people in the back office, not just its forecasting team -- to place bets, yes bets, on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before Christmas, on whether customers' new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company, on whether a project will come in on time. 
It's the only Spanish innovation, technologically, of the 20th century, by the way. 
We dance (Music) We dance, we make the club our own We chant at night to free our souls We dance, we make the club our home -- TM: Can you guys clap with us? 
I was so stunned and thrilled when Shawn had told me I had managed a one-hour-and-43-minute swim time. 
But at the time we enter that lake, at the very moment we enter that lake, we are stepping back three and a half billion years in the past of another planet, and then we are going to get the answer came for. 
(Applause) I am not an immigrant or a refugee myself, but I take these attacks personally, because my grandparents were. 
Can I get her to a hospital? Could I pay to get her a doctor? 
And part of the joy of it is, you know the difficulty. 
And marine protection plans must take into account how one area affects another. 
Everything you'll see here, except the car, is origami. 
My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours with computer science students. 
With this perspective, we are able to collapse reality into a simple matrix. 
FS: My job ends here, and the Nollywood filmmakers really have now to work. 
So fingers crossed. 
Children became more competent, and less helpless. 
So in February of 2009, Dr. Zullinger invited us, Project H Design -- which is a non-profit design firm that I founded -- to come to Bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district. 
These are properties of the universe that we can measure, and they're extremely dangerous because if they were different, even by a tiny bit, then the universe as we know it would not exist. 
And when I had to pay it, it felt annoying and it felt bad, but I paid it and I moved on. 
So what are emotions, really? 
And my look to the future is, and what I want to do with this doggy stuff, is to teach people that you know, your husband's just as easy to train. 
Well, I'm an ocean chemist. 
Eventually, the Royal Society and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit, and this has become -- fortunately it's become -- a major part of the scientific landscape today. 
And since then, we've taken 7.9 million miles off the roads and we've taken 1.4 thousand metric tons of CO2 out of the air. 
According to a lot of research, one of the best weapons is gratitude. 
ED: Okay, good. 
That empty space lasts essentially forever. 
You can think of these as neighborhoods, as distinctive as TriBeCa and the Upper East Side and Inwood -- that these are the forest and the wetlands and the marine communities, the beaches. 
We're going to continue to look at new ways of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world and connecting to the world around us. 
It's just because it works. 
According to his new hypothesis of principles and parameters, all languages shared certain grammatical principles, but could vary in their parameters, or the application of these principles. 
We're coming up on over 800 employees, and they live everywhere, from California to Alabama, Mississippi, to where I live in Texas. 
And no one would decide that the ocean was without fish on the basis of one glass of water. 
Before hyperbolic geometry, mathematicians knew about two kinds of space: Euclidean space, and spherical space. 
So I think the coffee cup lid will just continue to evolve, and you're going to see a move away from single-use plastic lids to lids that are a little more sustainable. 
This is a very, very unusual building in that there's no gravity load, but there's load in every direction. 
The whole point of acts of idiocy is that they leave you totally uninsured; they leave you exposed to the world and exposed to your own vulnerability and fallibility in face of, frankly, a fairly indifferent universe. 
Next time you install something, look at the settings and ask yourself, "Is this information that I want to share? 
In which case, my mother's weekly phone calls, asking me if my law school entrance exam scores were still valid was something I should probably pay more attention to. 
Now 51 percent do it. 
Monkeys in the zoo. 
We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings. 
So we have to continue to do the deep, internal work to address the biases that inform how, when and whether we see black girls for who they actually are, or what we've been told they are. 
That's why, a few years later, I joined with a group of college friends in bringing the Make Poverty History campaign to Australia. 
They key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like Styrofoam cups. 
And she implemented a dinner program. 
(Laughter) We felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day, but I could never have anticipated the outcome: nine to zero. 
And that ability to get others to want what you want, to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment, is what I call soft power. 
When I wrote my memoir, the publishers were really confused. 
You know, we enjoy it, and we don't -- this foundation has been a coming to for both of us in its continuous learning journey, and we don't travel together as much for the foundation, actually, as we used to when Bill was working at Microsoft. 
So we're spending all of this money, but we're getting what? 
Stephen Hawking is one of these physicists, more recently Alex Vilenkin, and the whole thing has been popularized by another very fine physicist and friend of mine, Lawrence Krauss, who wrote a book called "A Universe from Nothing," and Lawrence thinks that he's given — he's a militant atheist, by the way, so he's gotten God out of the picture. 
And here you see people like Mary Robinson, I went to see in Geneva. 
Transferring money across borders and across currencies is really expensive: friction. 
Well, interestingly, in the last presidential election, who was the number one, active opponent of this system of regulation in online speech? 
They also may be growing them. And we serve them in the cafeterias. 
Soon we had to escape from there, too. 
You see, the fathers of anatomy -- and I say "fathers" because, let's face it, they were all dudes -- were poking about between women's legs and trying to classify what they saw. 
Now the largest economic region in the world. 
And that'll make such a huge difference on the system, because the amount of waiting time and the amount of distances that people need to travel, often sometimes seven to 15 kilometers, sometimes by foot, to get a simple health check done, is very, very detrimental in the sense that it really dissuades people from getting access to health care. 
But just as quickly as they explode, more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer, so it's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same. 
Now if we look at nuclear -- (Laughter) With nuclear, what do we have? 
That's where they recruit from. That's where they get their power and strength. 
You've seen the documentaries of sweatshops making garments all over the world, even in developed countries. 
We don't know everything, but we don't know nothing, and we know what carbon dioxide does. 
Third, institutional design. 
You say, anytime you have a vacuum state, you will discover that one wheel will not turn another one, if the only connection between them is whatever was there before the vacuum. That kind of thing. 
They didn't talk a lot about loving ourselves. 
But if something really goes wrong in the submersible, you're not going to know it. 
At Ifakara we are firmly behind these goals. 
(Laughter) And ever since, I've been walking the mystic path, trying to peer beyond what Albert Einstein called the "optical delusion" of everyday consciousness. 
And people oohed and ahhed, because Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken. 
No? Yes? Doesn't matter, it worked. 
In addition, similar to human donation, if we only harvest one kidney from the pig, the pig can still be alive, so we are very mindful about the issues, but I think our goal is just to address the unmet medical need for those patients and their families. 
Now what we're doing is bringing the CEOs of these 80 companies together to help twist the arms of the final 20, to bring them to the table, because they don't like NGOs, they've never worked with NGOs, they're concerned about this, they're concerned about that, but we all need to be in this together. 
Originally I tried to do the words "figure" and "ground." 
(Music) (Applause) Now, this is Geli, and this is Reign. 
And let's say that works really well. 
Discovering this stuff is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science. 
Okay, we also built this injector, so this injector makes the plasma to start with. 
This could be you if at the start of party, you took a drug that meant you would not remember that party ever after that day. 
And thanks to the attraction of Green School, we had access to a steady stream of celebrities. 
They came from André Sougarret, who is a brilliant mining engineer who was appointed by the government to lead the rescue. 
It is a system, like traffic, which has components. 
We should stop watching, but we know we won't. 
And that will never stop being an important element of the way music is made, the way some of the best, most enduring music is made. 
This airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center. 
Well, we can measure renewables in the same units and other forms of power production in the same units. 
Why would I want to go back to a body that was so broken? 
The final step is, of course, the product, whether it's a packaging material, a table top, or building block. 
Supposedly, anyway. I believe that one. 
With millions of dollars being donated to end food insecurity, we should've solved hunger years ago. 
So the technical problems that need to be solved to make this work look quite difficult -- not as difficult as making a superintelligent A.I., but fairly difficult. 
We've invaded every country we've encountered. 
This is already impacting us. 
Now, if this makes you shudder with bad memories of school maths lessons, I sympathize, because I found school maths lessons boring, too. 
So here are some things we learned today. 
Oh, my God! 
Hence, the Mars watch. 
To put that into perspective, this red vertical bar here marks the divergence time of humans from chimpanzees, a mere seven million years ago. 
Forty-three. 
We want to actually close the loop between the human and the bionic external limb. 
So there were benefits here. 
Every second of every day, our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains. 
And this year, NASA opened up its entire research library to the public. 
They made bigger guns to shoot them down with. 
Maybe we can just say, "No, it's not possible." 
For me, curiosity about these things is a powerful driver, but there's more to the motivation here. 
We short-change ourselves. 
(Laughter) I'm trying, I'm trying. 
And frankly, I didn't know who I was, where I belonged, or what my purpose was. 
We do not experience this fluid quantum reality in our everyday lives. 
A debate that involves musicians, scientists, philosophers, writers, who get engaged with this question about climate engineering and think seriously about what its implications are. 
There's one way to treat jaundice, and that's what's called an exchange transfusion. 
We, who are atheists, are also a-fairyists and a-teapotists. 
(Laughter) "So no problem if you'd like to start with just one gram. 
And when you do go, you might wait for hours only to get the run-around and to be evaluated by a stoic figure in a white coat who only has 10 minutes to give you and who doesn't value the talk. 
It couldn't be further from the truth for me. 
Every single one of us will lose or has already lost something we rely on every single day. 
And having a low floor also means that we're removing the financial barrier that prevents people from completing a project. 
And we've done a number of different studies -- we've tried consumer choices, choices based on taste and smell and even reasoning problems. 
You've been very open about lots of issues on Twitter. 
(Laughter) Number two, John Gottman, psychologist and relationship researcher, can tell us many factors that correlate with a happy, successful marriage. 
Remember -- for play, for beauty, for truth, for justice and for love! 
And then there's the question of human survival. 
The challenge is to make sure everyone has pulled a lever before anyone hits the button. 
That way, you can do this work in comfortable pants. 
We're funded by donations from the public, and one of the more interesting things about that is how little money it actually takes to run Wikipedia. 
That’s all it took; their final treasure hadn’t stayed in the fire long enough. 
With whole grain bread, you have other obstacles. 
They are about men and women and the way we are -- not the way we look, but the way we are. 
Of course, I'm not sure they'll be up to it." 
Like with a time capsule, I was taking a look through a cultural window to the past. 
(Laughter) Their name in your inbox (Laughter) -- it's all you wanted anyway. 
I took a picture of this, hugged her and walked away. 
In fact, thinking of a robot coming from the future to help us run our governments sounds terrifying. 
I think this is what Uncle Ibrahim meant when he said that was a project of peace and unity, because I really felt that people were coming together. 
SW: I feel like she should have those moments, because she's never done anything bad to me, but I'm the youngest. I'm the younger sister. 
So where do you set up your new factory? 
Two seconds later, one looks at the other and says, "OK, let's go down." 
It mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices: rituals of entry, rituals of exit, the schedules, the uniforms in this country, things that identify you, team-building activities, team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids, or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time. 
Why is this? Well, this is one way to lose weight that works very well -- (Laughter) but it doesn't last, which is the problem. 
So a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes in the adolescent brain is using functional MRI to look at changes in brain activity across age. 
But there is something else that was remarkable about it. 
It's what helps us to understand the world around us. 
If you do this, the ingredients for the association of ideas are collected and form connections that will produce many ideas. 
It's filled with this toxic gas, hydrogen sulfide. 
(Laughter) (Applause) The second lesson was that I needed to stop being neutral at that point. 
(Applause) 
The first one, Judge Lourie, made up his own novel, biological theory -- totally wrong. 
How about a set of voices that have never been heard from before. 
It happens within it. 
and queen of hearts. Yes! 
That's what we're still trying to find answers to, and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species, and our ancestors are no exception. 
We've all seen those scenes: bombs destroying buildings, chaos, destruction and people screaming and running. 
There are simply not enough schools, water systems, sanitation. 
And in one generation, they're going from hunger and all of the detrimental health effects of hunger to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation. 
Bumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago, and then we had the first African exodus, as we call it. 
While a wonderful way to preserve human heritage, it doesn't have to be a choice. 
When Alex Pentland suggested to one company that they synchronize coffee breaks so that people would have time to talk to each other, profits went up 15 million dollars, and employee satisfaction went up 10 percent. 
And this one, which is really telling, this was from July, this cover article: "The personal metrics movement goes way beyond diet and exercise. It's about tracking every facet of life, from sleep to mood to pain, 24/7/365." 
Except, in your -- you're nodding -- now, in your ellipse, have you thought, "Well, what happens during the night?" 
We just do. We have to. (Applause) We've come a long way since the days of the Polaroid. 
It's lovely because it is an embodiment of something refreshing and delicious. 
You're basically face-to-face with someone that essentially decides life or death. 
Because for me, my Chicago isn't the nice architecture downtown, it's not the North Side. 
No, the music pushed me over, which is why I call it one-buttock playing. 
This is when Anonymous was forged out of the seemingly random collection of Internet dwellers. 
Parents should celebrate. 
I should study them? 
Uncertainty is often explained as a result of measurement, that the act of measuring an object's position changes its speed, or vice versa. 
The asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate, but not very large. And it's not very promising for life, since most of it consists of rock and metal, mostly rock. 
(Laughter) Right? So when I say consumer empowerment, and this is spreading beyond biotech, I actually really mean that. 
Well, the same things happen to our cells. 
What patterns can you find to guide him? 
So the question is, can we make it? 
We've treated it as an enemy. 
We discovered it. And what we found was that they have leaf-like structures on their toes, with millions of tiny hairs that look like a rug, and each of those hairs has the worst case of split-ends possible: about 100 to 1000 split ends that are nano-size. 
And I call this process agenticity. 
If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum, I'd say it falls somewhere between poetry and lies. 
We asked that to a junkie and they're like, "Are you nuts?" 
How do you live with yourself if you know you've committed horrific crimes? 
(Laughter) "Housework Makes Her Horny. 
Well, it turns out that we do have something just like that: our gut, or rather, its microbes. 
It is important to be as equally confident in your superpowers as you are in you FUBARs. 
Instead of testing how you take in and retain information, like an IQ test might, it tests how you manipulate information, given a constraint, in order to achieve a specific goal. 
It's just a wresting match, but a remarkable activity. 
It was so funny having a fake person who was making fake things. 
Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer. 
(Laughter) We just don't have the resolution. 
"I did not," says one person. 
Okay, so Frieda is my dead skeleton. 
And the preservation is, again, like those insects in [amber], phenomenal. 
We're talking about electric mobility that is happening today. 
What's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form? 
So the real key question was, how do we empower this woman? 
So you do so again. 
There I’m coming; she sees me. 
Like many younger incarcerees, Aki was determined to leave her camp. 
We want to get on the air quickly, and be taking science data -- what we astronomers call "first light," in 2021. 
Some of their decisions have really big impacts. 
Many small molecules failed during development as drugs because they just weren't specific enough to find their target in the complex environment of the human body. 
This is Sierra Leone. 
Nothing worked until I found this. 
And this really is the moment when our relationship, both with food and cities, changes completely. 
So, all in all, in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare, tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda. 
It's an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on. 
If it stays in Paris, as many are pushing for in the administration, well then that begs a question: What's the plan? 
The Bell X-1 was the first of many supersonic aircraft to follow, with later designs reaching speeds over Mach 3. 
Or it could be global, I mean, something we call innovation. 
(Laughter) But this seemingly dry math is actually the center of this tremendously powerful web that links technology -- that links really cool applications like music synthesizers to tremendous economic opportunities, but also governed by intellectual property. 
A lot of the Chinese consumers are still very new in their middle-class or upper-middle-class lifestyles, with a strong desire to buy everything new, new products, new services. 
Differences in fatigue? In appetite? In urination habits?" 
Today my dreams are informed by what I learned from them and what I've learned from you. 
Secondly, the new machine age is exponential. 
If you sell me a flat screen television or give me one as a gift, it will be the same good. 
And there were two treatments in this experiment. 
Adversity is good, and it has the potential to make you stronger. 
This isn't over. 
Historians aren't sure when or how this number was first discovered, but it's been known in some form for almost 4,000 years. 
We actually can't even imagine how much it affects us, because this is all we've ever had. 
He arrives, gowns up, And from there on in, their four hands are mostly in that patient -- with him guiding but Kristin leading the way. 
I think we're working on one of the most important things we possibly can, and that's to find another place for humans to live and survive and thrive. 
We were excited because this was an opportunity to show how much we had learned. 
A lot of the information is good. 
The good news is we identified a hundred companies two years ago. 
He doesn't care about religious differences, and get this: He has never told a lie. 
And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus. 
But, if a food is made of simple molecules, like a lollipop, some of these workers are put out of a job. 
That's important. Why is it important? 
And beyond Mars, the water in the solar system is all frozen. 
This object captures your touch, so you might press it very hard if you're angry, or stroke it if you're calm. 
They don't start with a grand convention and people coming together and then walking in lockstep with a statement. 
And again, I think he's going to remember that experience more than when I first came in, and there was a bit of hesitation. 
In medieval times, alchemists tried to achieve the seemingly impossible. 
Hanna Rosin: And why is that? 
My siblings and I grew up on our great-grandfather's farm in California. 
In fact, if only the water ice at the poles on Mars melted, most of the planet would be under 30 feet of water. 
Science is organized skepticism. 
What's natural about foie gras? 
This is what's going on. 
Oh, look how it lies there. 
We can plant those in the ground. 
The Wright Brothers built on history's failed attempts at flight, including some of their own, before designing a successful airplane. 
It's a world of phantoms, where particles can also behave like spread-out waves. 
I could assemble them into a life, a long life, a hundred-year life, the entirety of that same great sequence through which the luckiest among us pass. 
So maybe he's a little bit lazy, but he's there, he's taking care of the building. 
There was no press about it, so anybody who happened to walk into the museum to visit it that day would see us with these crazy lights. 
And I want to show you some of these examples. 
Secondly, if, for example, you're out and you're being verbally attacked by somebody, or you're suffering from a really disabling illness, does your partner step up and do what needs to be done to leave you feeling cared for and protected? 
I learned how to dance in heels, which means I can walk in heels. 
How can we address them?" 
He used one to buy the property, and another, which was in somebody else's name, to pay the huge bills it cost to run the place. 
There's no inherent meaning in information. 
The slow extinguishing of countless lives is just not dramatic enough, it would appear. 
What's next for you? What's next for Jetman? 
We say, "Yes, we're here for equality," and then we proudly pound our chest because we'd achieved 30 percent representation of women on an executive team. 
Some serious biologists, and I count myself among them, have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms, one might -- just might -- find aliens among them. 
It is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impact on our everyday life. Consider these statistics released by Activision. After one month of release of the game "Call Of Duty: Black Ops," it had been played for 68,000 years worldwide, right? 
And he appealed to virtue. 
When you look at it this way, the paradox of unanimity isn't actually all that paradoxical. 
But before we did the first experiments, we actually asked Art Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania to undertake a review of what the risks, the challenges, the ethics around creating new species in the laboratory were because it hadn't been done before. 
And the only thing we then ask is that "thank you for your service" needs to be more than just a quote break, that "thank you for your service" means honestly digging in to the people who have stepped up simply because they were asked to, and what that means for us not just now, not just during combat operations, but long after the last vehicle has left and after the last shot has been taken. 
So I really consider myself a storyteller. 
It is so critical that you should ask yourself regularly, "Who's carrying my paper into the room? 
GL also talked about the kids, and the ups and downs of the experience of living in this neighborhood, but he also spoke with pride of some of the organizations that had sprung up to provide support and empowerment. 
I think it's fair to say the data failed us this time -- and pretty spectacularly. 
And we don't have disposable people, either. 
And then the movement stops, like a caesura in poetry and the creator hovers. 
And in front of all that noise, you do a very small gesture. 
And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay for two and three times retail. 
And one of the things we've learned over the years is that perhaps the most powerful thing that Griselda and her family can do to get Griselda and her family out of poverty is to make sure that she goes to school. 
Over time, they added planks to the log boat base using the clinker, or "lapstrake," technique, meaning the planks overlapped and were fastened to each other along their edges. 
Cheating. 
But like even at my job -- like, I just got promoted. 
In the years that have passed, I've had a lot of time to think. 
KS: As this paper is bending, the resistance of the ink changes. 
We also work with collaborators to discover new ways of using these drones. 
I got the first and last D of my academic career. 
But she still lives in Mathare Valley. 
And the fourth reason, I believe, is what I've labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance. 
She is a three-time, back-to-back-to-back state champion in Shaolin Kempo. 
What we're most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution. 
The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years: two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother's womb; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother. 
Everybody's looking away all of a sudden. 
I want you to write a narrative, a narrative from the future of your city, and you can date it, set it out one year from now, five years from now, a decade from now, a generation from now, and write it as a case study looking back, looking back at the change that you wanted in your city, looking back at the cause that you were championing, and describing the ways that that change and that cause came, in fact, to succeed. 
Do you think you're designing one thing, and then when it's produced it looks like something else? 
The poor will always be with you. 
So I'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone. 
And if you are prone to oversharing, try editing. 
(Laughter) It was released in 1991. 
(Laughter) Of course a lot of this was tongue-in-cheek, but that word feminist is so heavy with baggage, negative baggage. 
You leave aside what is natural to be natural. 
If everybody in the developed world understood this graph, and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads, there would be no further societal argument about climate change because this is the story that counts. 
And when you think about some of the more classic or historical fraud cases, it always is around a whistle-blower. 
And this region, the regions within the limbic system, have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults, and at the very same time, the prefrontal cortex, which you can see in blue in the slide here, which stops us taking excessive risks, is still very much in development in adolescents. 
I also brought grandmothers into the mix. 
And I'd be like, "No, you can't! 
I used to puzzle about a lot of things as a boy, for example: What would it feel like to be a dog? 
Thank you. I have two missions here today. 
So since I've had this result, I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what kinds of decision rules -- very simple, local, probably olfactory, chemical rules could an ant could be using, since no ant can assess the global situation -- that would have the outcome that I see, these predictable dynamics, in who does what task. 
Now she remains a part of the landscape she loved so much, even as it, too, passes and takes on new form. 
This plant is called the Welwitschia, and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola, where it's uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea. 
(Laughter) You know how many people watch these TED Talks? 
It's no more about going out and finding a tree that's been cut. 
And I also have the hand closed and open. 
And if there's anything that's been learned about burn, it's that we don't know how to treat it. 
We're still inventing, and this is what technology is allowing us to do; it's continually to reinvent ourselves. 
So, where are you a local? 
We brought it on air in November 2009. 
We proposed a building that was audacious, that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to, and we were scared and our client was scared and the community was scared, so we created a series of photorealistic renderings that we put onto Facebook and we put onto Instagram, and we let people start to do what they do: share it, comment, like it, hate it. 
And this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day. 
So here's how you do that. 
Another one was on the photoelectric effect, that's why solar panels work, it's a nice one. 
And it should be a male victim, that's the only thing. 
And we saw a lot of Asian people. 
So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second. 
(Laughter) But why? 
And on guitar is my 14-year-old brother, Tommy. 
One of the most unique things that bats do as a mammal is that they fly. 
The perception of director or a leader is inconsistent with the perception of a woman. 
And all the collective minds in this room, I dare say, can never find a solution for scan-xiety. 
It got even worse than I could have ever imagined. 
Yeah, they wrote to defend the idea that there had to be a reason for what happened to me. 
In the developing world, the data is much sketchier but the death toll is almost certainly higher. 
But geckos do it better. 
Jason's parents had asked him to do so. 
When I say that Country X is the goodest country on Earth, and I mean goodest, I don't mean best. 
Even before his disability, Mohammed's life wasn't easy. 
We imagine black people living and thriving. 
Rather, that all men are equal in terms of their rights, and that every person ought to be treated as an individual, and not prejudged by the statistics of particular groups that they may belong to. 
We all love to live to 80, which was impossible 300 years ago. 
They graded her feminism, instead of simply taking a grown, accomplished woman at her word. 
It may be a way to maintain a certain diversity. 
It's a nerve-wracking experience. 
Stem cells beneath the lining of your intestines replace these cells as they wear out. 
They fix sewers, they get the trains running. 
And then we wonder why so many children don't read. 
We can change this behavior, however. 
And instead of thinking, "How can I personally identify with this character?" 
Or you are critical and inquisitive when researching for a larger purchase online. 
And what's more, is that this lab showed that you actually could improve next-day memory performance with this sound. 
You can find out where your relatives come from; you can do your genealogy going back thousands of years. 
He was loaned to us by a mining company. 
They had hit the jackpot. 
It's made out of ice. 
Childhood bipolar -- children as young as four are being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums, which scores them high on the bipolar checklist. 
Domestic workers know that any time a single person becomes disposable, it's a slippery slope. 
I'd like to close with a profile of one of my favorite modern-day Stoics. 
They all bitched about each other. I mean, quite gossipy, those cables. Okay, but I thought it was a very important point for all of us to grasp, these are human beings just like us. They don't have special powers. 
This challenge is staggering -- so much so, that recently, a team at Anglia Ruskin Global Sustainability Institute suggested that if we don't change our global policies and food production systems, our societies might actually collapse in the next 30 years. 
In Georgia, after years of stalemate, we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence in August, 2008. 
Controlled experiments have shown that optimism is not only related to success, it leads to success. 
From three years ago, it just being an idea, this has become something that has virally swept around the world. 
And so we had from January to April to get this done. 
It's a spectacular achievement. 
Please download your copy, and thank you very much. 
And that's not it. 
This is a photograph of the object. 
Treating people as machines may be scientifically and philosophically accurate, but it's a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next. 
And all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom. 
So it's right up in the heavens. 
Now, I think of OKRs as transparent vessels that are made from the whats and hows of our ambitions. 
At least I have the privilege to see family today, and then I'm sure tomorrow I'm heading back in the trenches. 
So this is a small crank generator. 
And Ivan puts his sandwich over here, on top of the pirate chest. 
It's not just a root supplying a plant, but for each of those plants, whatever it is -- a presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data -- they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together, and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is.

Where is it?" 
So you see, it's almost like a Pavlovian -- we lost the first hundred years of psychology by really trivial theories, where you say, how do people learn how to react to a situation?
